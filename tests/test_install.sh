# Never inherit the caller's TTY on stdin. install.sh's fresh-install first-
# source prompt is deliberately offered only when `[ -t 0 ]` (stdin is a
# terminal) - see its own comment above that check. Every install.sh
# invocation below is automated and expects no interactive input; run from
# a real terminal without this, `[ -t 0 ]` would be true for those
# invocations (this script's own stdin, inherited by every command and
# command substitution it runs), and a fresh-config install would open
# /dev/tty and block waiting for input that never arrives. Redirecting once,
# here, covers every current and future install.sh call in this file - the
# same effect `assert_success`/`assert_failure` already get for stdout/
# stderr via their own `>/dev/null 2>&1`, just for stdin, and just once
# instead of at each call site. This never affects install.sh's own
# production behavior (`[ -t 0 ]` is still checked honestly - it now
# genuinely reads "no" for these automated runs) and never affects a real
# interactive install run outside this test suite. CI already runs with no
# TTY on stdin, which is exactly why this bug never reproduced there.
