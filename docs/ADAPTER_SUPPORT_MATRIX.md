# Cheats & Mods adapter support matrix

A concise, current-state summary of what each Cheats & Mods emulator
adapter can actually do. See
[`docs/CHEATS_MODS_SAFETY.md`](CHEATS_MODS_SAFETY.md) and
[`docs/CHEATS_MODS_USER_POLICY.md`](CHEATS_MODS_USER_POLICY.md) for the
trust and safety model behind every row below, and the per-adapter
documents linked in each row for full detail.

## Cheats, patches, and mods are not the same thing

- **Cheats** are small, targeted value changes (a RetroArch `.cht` entry,
  a Dolphin `[ActionReplay]`/`[Gecko]` code).
- **Patches** are broader per-game fixes distributed as files (a PCSX2
  `.pnach` can contain a widescreen-hack patch alongside cheat codes in
  the same file; RetroArch also has separate soft-patch formats). EmuWiz
  inspects these the same conservative way it inspects cheats - as inert,
  unevaluated data - but does not yet distinguish "patch" from "cheat" as
  a first-class category anywhere in the GUI.
- **Mods** (textures, graphics packs, resource packs, Riivolution assets,
  and similar larger content replacements) are supported only in a narrow
  Dolphin texture workflow. Selected PNG textures and validated,
  manifest-backed texture packs can be inspected, previewed, applied, and
  rolled back. General mod adapters, arbitrary package inspection, and
  Riivolution/resource-pack support remain unavailable.

## Matrix

| Adapter | Identity | Local inspection | Trusted provider | Preview | Apply | Backup | Rollback | Mods | Current blocker |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RetroArch** | Verified exact/strong trusted-catalogue match; weak/ambiguous candidates never count as coverage | N/A - the source is the trusted catalogue itself, not an emulator-managed directory to inventory | **Yes** - reviewed `libretro-database` provider, Download/Update/Verify from Sources, immutable content-addressed snapshots | Yes, shared model; bounded coverage audit available | **Yes** - explicit confirmation, separate replacement approval, background execution | Yes - verified, never-overwritten backup before any replacement | Yes - fresh preview re-derived before acting, blocks on user-modified content or a missing/changed backup | Not implemented | Catalogue breadth varies by system/title; ordinary `.cht` files usually lack explicit serial, region, revision, hash, and core fields. See [`CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md`](CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md) |
| **PCSX2** | Verified executable CRC required; verified serial and trusted region constraints checked when present | Yes - inventories existing `cheats`/`cheats_ws`/`patches` directories and `.pnach` files, read-only | Provider-neutral approved-record model; no bundled downloadable ordinary-cheat provider | Yes, shared model with selected managed PNACH blocks | **Yes** - the GUI stages exact selected approved records, previews the final PNACH, and requires explicit confirmation | Yes - verified, never-overwritten backup before replacement | Yes - exact prior bytes or removal of a transaction-created file, with stale/external-change blocking | Not implemented | Approve and integrate a licensed ordinary-cheat provider; see [`PCSX2_CHEAT_ADAPTER.md`](PCSX2_CHEAT_ADAPTER.md) |
| **Dolphin** | Verified Game ID, encoded region, and revision via the shared bounded disc reader | Yes - inventories optional existing `GameSettings/*.ini` files, including Gecko and Action Replay names | **Yes** - exact-ID lookup in the official Dolphin upstream GameSettings dataset, with bounded retrieval and local cache | Yes, including individual Gecko-code selection, complete generated sections, preserved sections, final hash, and bounded coverage audit | **Yes** - safely merges `[Gecko]` and `[Gecko_Enabled]` after explicit preview/confirmation; creates the exact INI when absent | Yes - verified, never-overwritten backup before replacement | Yes - restores exact previous bytes or removes an INI created by the transaction | **Selected texture files and manifest-backed texture packs** | Cheat provider apply is Gecko-only; texture support is deliberately narrow and does not cover arbitrary mods or Riivolution assets. Upstream coverage varies and does not normally declare per-code disc revisions. See [`CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md`](CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md) |
| **Xenia (Xbox 360)** | Verified Title ID and Media ID from the unencrypted XEX2 module header (direct `.xex` or a single `.xex` inside a ZIP) | N/A - no local bulk inventory; the exact destination file is checked individually once a candidate is chosen | **Yes** - exact-Title-ID lookup in `xenia-canary/game-patches`, via a cached, revision-pinned repository index (never a full clone per lookup) and per-file immutable caching | Yes, shared model, including individual patch selection, the exact merged `.patch.toml`, preserved unrelated definitions, and final hash | **Yes** - merges selected patches into the exact destination `.patch.toml` after explicit preview/confirmation; a `PartiallyVerified` candidate (module hash never computed/verified by EmuWiz) additionally requires an explicit acknowledgement before it can be staged at all | Yes - verified, never-overwritten backup before replacement | Yes - restores exact previous bytes or removes a file created by the transaction | Not implemented | See [`XENIA_PROVIDER.md`](XENIA_PROVIDER.md) for the full identity/compatibility model; no native Xenia Canary install path is auto-detected (explicit directory only) |

## Notes on "Apply" specifically

"Apply" above means: the GUI offers a real Install/Replace control backed
by the shared safe-apply transaction engine (atomic write, verified
backup before replacement, journal, and rollback). It does **not** mean
"EmuWiz runs the cheat" - EmuWiz never executes cheat, patch, or mod
content at any stage, for any adapter, in preview, apply, or rollback.
PCSX2's apply/rollback contract is available only for caller-provided, approved,
verified ordinary-cheat records; the GUI wires those records into the shared
preview, confirmation, apply, history, and rollback flow. EmuWiz does not bundle
a downloadable ordinary-cheat catalogue for PCSX2. Dolphin's reviewed Gecko path can merge selected upstream definitions into an existing
exact-ID GameSettings file or create that file when absent. Xenia's reviewed
patch path does the same for `.patch.toml`. Neither installs other mod types.

## Snapshot vs. individual-entry trust

A **Trusted** provider (RetroArch's `libretro-database`) means EmuWiz
has reviewed the source's ownership, format, host, and retrieval limits -
it does **not** mean every individual cheat entry inside that catalogue
has been reviewed for correctness. An entry can be structurally valid and
still simply not work as expected in a given game/region/revision; that is
a catalogue-content question, separate from EmuWiz's own trust and
safety guarantees.
