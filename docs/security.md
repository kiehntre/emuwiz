# EmuWiz Security Design

This document describes the security boundaries and safety rules for EmuWiz.

EmuWiz mounts untrusted archive files as folders, and separately offers a
small number of explicitly gated features that write to the filesystem or
fetch data over the network (DAT-driven rename, cheat/patch installation,
and identity/artwork providers). Archives may be incomplete, corrupt,
malicious, or unexpectedly large. The security design should assume archive
contents and filenames are attacker-controlled, and that every write path
must be either read-only by construction or explicit, previewed, and gated.

## Goals

- Never mutate a source archive, ROM, or disc image as part of mounting,
  inspection, cataloguing, or identity resolution.
- Where a feature does intentionally rename or otherwise write files (DAT
  rename/apply; explicit cheat/patch installers), require an explicit,
  previewed, user-approved action, and make the operation safe to interrupt,
  audit, and undo.
- Only mount archives discovered from configured source folders.
- Only unmount mountpoints created under the configured `mount_root`.
- Avoid path traversal through archive filenames, internal paths, or generated mount names.
- Keep mount backend behavior isolated behind `MountBackend`.
- Make failures visible and retryable without hiding unsafe state.
- Treat network access to third-party providers (RomM, RetroArch, Dolphin,
  Xenia, GameHacking, BSFree, and similar) as explicit and attributable, never
  automatic or silent.

## Non-Goals

- No native FUSE implementation - `ratarmount` remains the mount backend.
- There is no separate daemon process, so there is no daemon-specific
  security model to design.
- No formal GUI permission model beyond the same config-identity and
  mount/unmount safety checks the CLI uses.
- No Docker or container sandbox design.
- No malware scanning.

## Trust Boundaries

### Config File

EmuWiz reads configuration from its own XDG paths first, and transparently
falls back to the legacy ArchiveFS paths when only they exist (no data is
ever copied, moved, or overwritten by this resolution - see
`crates/archivefs-core/src/app_dirs.rs`):

```text
~/.config/emuwiz/config.toml           (preferred; used if present)
~/.config/archivefs/config.toml        (legacy fallback; used if the EmuWiz
                                         path does not exist yet)
```

The same EmuWiz-first-with-legacy-fallback rule applies to the data directory
(`~/.local/share/emuwiz`, falling back to `~/.local/share/archivefs`) that
holds the catalogue database, DAT rename journals, and other managed state.

The config controls source folders, mount root, and the ratarmount binary path. EmuWiz should treat config as user-controlled but not archive-controlled.

Security rules:

- Source folders must be explicit absolute non-root paths. Scans reject duplicate or
  nested roots and refuse symlink components; symlink entries encountered below a
  valid root are never followed.
- Recursive scans are deterministic and bounded by entry and depth limits. They skip
  special files and revalidate source/archive filesystem identity before catalogue
  persistence.
- Mounts must be created under the configured `mount_root`.
- Unmount operations must never target paths outside `mount_root`.

### Source Archives

Archive files are untrusted input.

Security rules for mounting, inspection, and cataloguing:

- Mounting, signature-based platform detection, disc/archive identity
  inspection, and catalogue refresh never modify or delete a source archive,
  ROM, or disc image. These paths are read-only by construction.
- Do not extract archives into source folders.
- Do not trust archive filenames as safe path components.
- Skip obvious split archive continuation parts to avoid mounting incomplete fragments.
- Mark unsupported, corrupt, missing-part, and permission failures in archive health instead of guessing.
- Catalogue refreshes use one SQLite write transaction with per-source savepoints, so
  a failed source cannot leave partial rows and a fatal refresh cannot expose a
  half-updated catalogue.

#### DAT-driven rename is a separate, explicitly gated mutation path

Unlike mounting and inspection, EmuWiz's DAT rename feature **does** rename
source files on disk once a user explicitly reviews and approves a plan. This
is intentional, and is designed as a narrow, auditable exception to the
read-only rule above rather than a silent one:

- **Planning is read-only.** `crates/archivefs-core/src/dat/rename_plan/`
  builds a proposed rename plan from an audit and the effective matching
  policy without renaming anything; collisions and unsafe (symlink/special)
  sources are flagged in the plan, not acted on.
- **Apply requires explicit, per-item approval.** Only proposals a user has
  marked `AcceptedForReview` are ever included in a transaction
  (`is_approved` / `build_transaction` in
  `crates/archivefs-core/src/dat/rename_apply/executor.rs`).
- **Stale-plan and stale-classifier gates.** Both `build_transaction` and
  `apply_transaction` reject a plan whose generation or classifier version
  does not match the current state (`ApplyError::StalePlan`,
  `ApplyError::StaleClassifierVersion`) before any journal write or file
  mutation occurs, so classification-rule changes since the plan was built
  can never be silently applied.
- **Preflight runs twice.** The whole batch is preflighted before the first
  mutation, and each entry is preflighted again immediately before its own
  rename, so a change that happens between review and apply (a different
  inode, a symlink substitution, an appearing destination) is caught rather
  than blindly executed.
- **The journal is durable and written before mutation.** Every transaction
  is journaled to disk before the first rename, and each entry's state is
  checkpointed to `Applying` before its rename syscall runs, so a crash
  mid-batch leaves a recoverable, inspectable record rather than silent data
  loss (`write_journal`, journal-backed recovery/reconciliation in
  `crates/archivefs-core/src/dat/rename_apply/reconcile.rs`).
- **Renames are no-clobber and filesystem-confirmed.** `rename_noreplace`
  never overwrites an existing destination, and after each rename the
  executor confirms the source is gone and the destination exists with the
  identity captured at review time before marking the entry `Applied`
  (`confirm_rename` in `executor.rs`).
- **Rollback is supported.** Applied transactions can be rolled back through
  `crates/archivefs-core/src/dat/rename_apply/rollback.rs`, including
  journals from before the classifier-version enforcement change, which
  remain inspectable and recoverable.

Outside of this explicitly gated apply path, the "do not modify or delete
source archives" rule above still holds: nothing else in EmuWiz renames,
extracts into, or deletes a source archive, ROM, or disc image.

### Mount Root

The mount root is the only place EmuWiz should create mount directories.

Security rules:

- Generate safe mount names from archive names.
- Resolve duplicate mount names deterministically.
- Treat pre-existing mount directories as potentially suspicious unless they are confirmed mounted by EmuWiz.
- Only unmount paths under `mount_root`.
- Prefer unmounting known mounted paths from system mount information, filtered by `mount_root`.

### Mount Backend

EmuWiz currently uses `ratarmount` through `RatarmountBackend`.

Security rules:

- Core mount logic should depend on the `MountBackend` trait.
- Backend implementations should receive a `MountPlan`, not raw unvalidated strings.
- Backend command arguments should be passed as arguments, not shell-concatenated command strings.
- Backend failures should be surfaced as health or command errors.

### Providers and Emulator Profiles

EmuWiz includes several identity and cheat/patch providers that reach the
network and, for a narrow set of emulator adapters, can write to emulator
configuration after explicit confirmation. This is not a read-only surface,
and this document does not claim it is:

- **Identity/artwork providers** (RomM, and platform artwork sources) fetch
  metadata and images over the network when a source is configured and a
  fetch is explicitly triggered (scan, refresh, or an explicit lookup). See
  `crates/archivefs-cli/src/romm_identity.rs` and the `romm_*` GUI modules
  under `crates/archivefs-gui/src/`.
- **RomM's endpoint is policy-restricted, not arbitrary.** Unlike the public
  catalogue/cheat providers above, RomM is a separately configured local or
  private service, and its URL is validated against a local-only endpoint
  policy (`crates/archivefs-core/src/identity_source/net_policy.rs`) before
  any request is made: only `http` or `https`, only to a host that, when
  resolved *at validation time*, resolves entirely within loopback, RFC 1918,
  or IPv6 unique-local ranges (every address observed during that resolution
  must be approved), never a known cloud-metadata address, and never a URL
  carrying embedded credentials. Any public, mixed, or otherwise disallowed
  answer seen during validation is refused outright. This validation reduces
  but does not eliminate DNS-rebinding risk: the actual HTTP connection is
  made later by `ureq`, which performs its own independent DNS resolution at
  connect time, and the validated address is not currently pinned through to
  that connection. A DNS answer that changes between validation time and
  connection time - a malicious or misbehaving resolver answering
  differently on the second lookup - remains outside this guarantee.
  Closing that gap would require pinning the validated address into the
  actual socket connection, which is not implemented today. The production
  HTTP client (`UreqTransport`) is also configured with `max_redirects(0)`,
  so every redirect response is refused unconditionally and none is ever
  followed under any circumstance; an attempted redirect's destination may
  still be classified against the same policy purely for diagnostic/logging
  purposes (so the refusal message can name where the server tried to send
  the request), but that classification never results in the redirect being
  followed. It also ignores proxy environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`,
  `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`): the connection always goes straight to the
  approved address, so a session-wide proxy can never receive the token.
  Because the policy allows RomM to be reached over plain HTTP, a
  token sent to an HTTP endpoint has no TLS transport protection for that
  request - this is a property of HTTP, not something the client works
  around, and it is the reason the endpoint policy exists to bound *where*
  HTTP is even reachable.
- **RomM tokens are user-supplied and file-based, never inline config.**
  A token is read from a file the user names with `--token-file` (or the GUI
  equivalent); `load_token_file`
  (`crates/archivefs-core/src/identity_source/settings.rs`) refuses a
  missing file, a symlink, a non-regular file, an oversized file, and - on
  Unix - a file with any group or world permission bit set, before ever
  reading its contents. `RommSourceConfig` persists only the token file's
  *path* (`token_path: Option<PathBuf>`); the token value itself is never
  written into EmuWiz's own configuration. EmuWiz's production code paths
  only ever read a token file the user already created themselves; nothing
  in the CLI or GUI writes or creates one.
- **Cheat/patch catalogue providers** (RetroArch catalogue, GameHacking.org
  for PS2/GameCube/Wii, BSFree Archive) perform certificate-validated HTTPS
  retrieval, bounded parsing, and provenance/hash recording of the fetched
  catalogue data. Catalogue retrieval alone does not install anything or
  modify an emulator's configuration - see `docs/CHEATS_MODS_SAFETY.md` for
  the fuller trust/inspection model these adapters follow.
- **Emulator-profile writes** (RetroArch, PCSX2, Dolphin/GameCube, Dolphin/Wii,
  Xenia cheat/patch installers) discover an emulator's profile directory
  read-only, and only ever write to it as an explicit install action the user
  previews and confirms - never automatically during discovery, a scan, or a
  catalogue fetch. Installers use atomic replacement and backups where
  applicable, verify the live target before writing, and record what they
  changed so the same install can be identified and reversed (managed-only
  removal / Undo). See `crates/archivefs-core/src/patch_manager/` and
  `docs/PATCH_CHEAT_MANAGER_DESIGN.md`.
- **Installer ownership of files on disk** (`install.sh`) is tracked and
  reasoned about separately from the above - see
  [`README.md`'s installer section](../README.md#quick-install) and the
  installer's own SHA-256 ownership-manifest logic. This document does not
  restate that mechanism.

No provider network access or emulator-profile write happens automatically on
startup, on a background timer, or as a side effect of mounting or
cataloguing archives.

#### Provider network routing

EmuWiz does not implicitly honour proxy settings inherited from the process
environment. Every in-process HTTP client (`ureq` agent) in the workspace is
built with `.proxy(None)`, so `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY` (either
case) and `NO_PROXY` have no effect on it. In particular, ScreenScraper,
Hasheous and RomM connect directly to their approved endpoints: ScreenScraper
requests carry the user's ScreenScraper credentials in the query string,
Hasheous lookups carry the hashes of the user's files, and RomM requests carry
a bearer token, and none of that traffic is routed to a proxy because of an
environment variable the user may not know is set. The policy is held by
`identity_source/provider_proxy_tests.rs` (ScreenScraper and Hasheous) and
`identity_source/romm/tests.rs` (RomM), which run each variable on its own in
a child process with an otherwise empty environment.

This covers HTTP requests EmuWiz makes itself. It does not describe programs
EmuWiz launches or external tools it hands work to, which have their own
network behaviour.

If proxy support is ever added it must be explicit: configured by the user
inside EmuWiz, scoped to named transports, off by default, and documented with
what a proxy operator would be able to see (destination and timing for HTTPS,
the full request for plain HTTP). It must not be read from the environment.

## Path Safety

EmuWiz must not allow archive names or internal archive paths to escape the configured mount area.

Required behavior:

- Convert unsafe filename characters to safe mount-name characters.
- Collapse repeated separators where practical.
- Trim unsafe leading and trailing separators.
- Fall back to a neutral name such as `archive` when a filename has no safe characters.
- Never use archive-internal paths to create host filesystem paths outside a mounted archive view.

## Health and Retry Safety

Archive health exists to make unsafe or incomplete states explicit.

Important states:

- `Failed`: a mount or inspection operation failed.
- `MissingParts`: a split archive appears incomplete.
- `Corrupt`: the archive appears damaged.
- `Unsupported`: the archive format or layout is unsupported.
- `PermissionDenied`: EmuWiz cannot read or mount the archive.
- `RetryAvailable`: a failed archive can be retried.

Retry behavior should be explicit. EmuWiz should not silently retry in a tight loop or hide repeated failures.

## Future Work

Future versions should consider:

- Persistent ownership records for mountpoints in SQLite.
- Stronger source-root canonicalization.
- Symlink and bind-mount checks around `mount_root`.
- Separate health diagnostics for missing split archive parts.
- Optional archive hashing before mount.
- Permission checks before invoking mount backends.
- Daemon-specific least-privilege rules.
- GUI warnings for corrupt, unsupported, or permission-denied archives.

## Summary

The current security posture is conservative, with a small number of
explicitly gated exceptions rather than a blanket read-only guarantee:

- Archives are mounted read-only through ratarmount.
- Mounting, inspection, and cataloguing never modify a source archive, ROM,
  or disc image.
- DAT-driven rename is the one path that does modify source files, and only
  after explicit per-item approval, generation and classifier-version gates,
  batch-and-per-entry preflight, a durable pre-mutation journal, no-clobber
  renames, and filesystem confirmation (see the DAT rename subsection above).
- Mount directories are generated under `mount_root`.
- Unmounting is restricted to paths under `mount_root`.
- The persistent catalogue, managed library views, and the read-only
  PCSX2 patch-preview feature all follow the same rule: they read or
  organize existing state, and none of them is a dependency of mount or
  unmount safety (see [ADR 0001](adr/0001-persistent-library-database.md)).
- Identity/artwork providers and cheat/patch catalogues reach the network
  only when explicitly triggered; emulator-profile writes require explicit
  preview and confirmation and are never automatic.
- Config and data directories prefer EmuWiz's own XDG paths and transparently
  fall back to the legacy ArchiveFS paths when only they exist; resolution is
  read-only and never copies, moves, or overwrites data.
- Native FUSE and Docker packaging remain out of scope. A desktop GUI now
  exists and reuses the same core safety checks as the CLI rather than its
  own permission model.
