# GUI ↔ Backend Capability Matrix

> **Historical / superseded snapshot**

> This matrix records an earlier GUI integration state based on campaign base

Maps each design-reference screen (`design-reference/EmuWiz design stage
one.zip` — screens confirmed present by text search: Mount, Selected,
Active Mounts, Library, Sources, Doctor, History & Logs, Settings, About) to
the current state of `archivefs-core`/`archivefs-gui` as of campaign base
commit `fd0b4b143d64d9f8d681054eb60e8b4b8a41edd6`.

Status legend used throughout:

- **Integrated** — implemented in `archivefs-core` and already wired into
  `archivefs-gui`.
- **Backend complete, not integrated** — implemented and tested in
  `archivefs-core` (and usually CLI-reachable), no GUI code references it.
- **Partial** — some sub-interactions integrated, others not.
- **Prototype-only** — appears in the design with no backend of any kind.
- **Intentionally unsupported** — a deliberate non-goal (see
  `FABLE_CAMPAIGN_PLAN.md` §25); should not be built even if a backend
  could technically be added.

## Summary of genuinely missing backend capability (not just unwired GUI)

1. No general-purpose persisted operation-history store (History & Logs).
2. No direct "list active mounts" query (works today only by filtering all
   records — acceptable to reuse, not a hard blocker).
3. No update-check mechanism.
4. No support-bundle composer.
5. No mid-flight cancellation for any long-running core operation.

Everything else under RetroArch, Mount, Active Mounts, Doctor, Sources, and
Library is backend-complete and only needs GUI wiring.
