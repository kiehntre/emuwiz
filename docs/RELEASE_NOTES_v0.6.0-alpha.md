# ArchiveFS v0.6.0-alpha - Release Notes

> **Historical release document**
>
> This file describes EmuWiz as it existed for this release. It is retained for release history, not current capability guidance. See the [README](../README.md) and [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for current behavior.

**Release classification: alpha.** This is pre-1.0, actively developed
software. Nothing in this document should be read as a promise of
stability, and the interfaces it describes may still change before a 1.0
release.

**This release has not shipped yet.** `Cargo.toml` now reads `0.6.0-alpha`
in preparation for tagging, but no `v0.6.0-alpha` Git tag exists yet. This
document describes the current state of `main` and will be finalized once
the remaining item in [`docs/V0.6_RELEASE_AUDIT.md`](V0.6_RELEASE_AUDIT.md)'s
go/no-go checklist - a real manual Nobara QA pass - is cleared.

## Headline features

1. **Shared verified game identity.** ArchiveFS can now read narrowly
   defined, local disc metadata for a selected PS2, GameCube, or Wii
   archive - a typed evidence report (`Verified`/`Candidate`/`Missing`/
   etc.), never a guessed name. See
   [`docs/SHARED_GAME_IDENTITY.md`](SHARED_GAME_IDENTITY.md).
2. **Shared read-only Cheats & Mods preview and conflict detection**
   across all three adapters, with no apply path of its own. See
   [`docs/SHARED_CHEAT_PREVIEW.md`](SHARED_CHEAT_PREVIEW.md).
3. **A shared safe apply, backup, journal, history, and rollback
   foundation**: atomic writes, verified never-overwritten backups,
   schema-versioned journals, truthful partial-success reporting, and
   rollback that blocks on user-modified content. See
   [`docs/SHARED_SAFE_APPLY_ROLLBACK.md`](SHARED_SAFE_APPLY_ROLLBACK.md).
4. **RetroArch GUI apply, history, and rollback.** An eligible exact or
   approved-strong RetroArch trusted-catalogue match can now be applied
   directly from Cheats & Mods, with explicit confirmation, a separate
   non-preselected replacement approval, background execution, and a
   result shown as success, partial success, or failure. History & Logs
   can open the exact operation and preview/confirm its rollback. See
   [`docs/RETROARCH_GUI_APPLY_HISTORY.md`](RETROARCH_GUI_APPLY_HISTORY.md).
5. **RetroArch trusted-catalogue download and management.** The Sources
   page now owns catalogue retrieval end-to-end: Download, Update, and a
   read-only Verify, each gated behind an explicit review-then-confirm
   dialog before any network access. See
   [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md`](RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md).
6. **Recently Found.** A new navigation page listing only the newest
   completed scan's added archives, in exact path order, persisted across
   restarts.
7. **Mega Drive/Genesis loose-ROM recognition**, gated on an exactly-named
   folder component so an unrelated `README.md` is never mistaken for a
   ROM. See [`docs/LIBRARY_SCAN_USABILITY.md`](LIBRARY_SCAN_USABILITY.md).
8. **RetroArch catalogue parse-tolerance fix.** An individual malformed or
   unsupported entry in a downloaded trusted catalogue no longer affects
   validation of the whole snapshot; the catalogue archive size limits were
   raised to match the real official catalogue (256 MiB per entry, 1 GiB
   expanded); and stale "not yet implemented" Cheats & Mods copy left over
   from before RetroArch apply shipped has been removed.

## Safety model

- **Explicit confirmation, always.** Nothing installs, applies, or
  modifies anything without it. Replacing existing different content
  requires a *separate*, non-preselected approval beyond the general
  apply confirmation.
- **ArchiveFS does not execute cheat files** - or any other retrieved or
  inspected content - at any stage of preview, apply, or rollback, for any
  adapter.
- **Catalogue download is a separate step from cheat installation.**
  Fetching or updating the RetroArch trusted catalogue never installs
  anything; installation is its own explicit, confirmed action.
- **Atomic writes and verified backups.** Every write goes through an
  exclusive-create-temp-file-then-rename sequence with post-write
  verification; a replacement always creates a verified, never-overwritten
  backup first.
- **Truthful partial success.** If a destination write succeeds but the
  journal write that records it fails, the result is reported as partial
  success - never silent success, never an opaque hard failure.
- **Stale-plan rejection.** A confirmed apply is bound to a SHA-256 plan
  ID covering the exact adapter, archive, identity, profile, and
  destination; any change between preview and confirmation fails closed.
- **Rollback safety.** Rollback re-derives a fresh preview immediately
  before acting and blocks on user-modified destination content, a
  missing or changed backup, or an already-completed rollback.
- **Locking.** Every shared-apply transaction holds an exclusive advisory
  lock on its one destination root (five-second timeout); one transaction
  always has exactly one root, so lock ordering is deadlock-free.
- **No network during Apply or Rollback.** The only network access
  anywhere in this workflow is the explicit, user-confirmed RetroArch
  catalogue Download/Update step.
- **No automatic conflict resolution.** Duplicate destinations, filename
  collisions, and ambiguous matches are all surfaced as typed conflicts,
  never silently resolved.
- **Trust is about the provider, not every individual entry.** RetroArch's
  built-in catalogue provider is reviewed (ownership, format, host, and
  retrieval limits) - that is not a claim that every individual cheat
  entry inside it is correct for every game/region/revision. See
  [`docs/ADAPTER_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`](ADAPTER_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md).

## Supported adapters

See [`docs/ADAPTER_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`](ADAPTER_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md) for the
full matrix. In brief:

- **RetroArch**: verified identity, trusted provider, preview, **apply,
  backup, and rollback all available**.
- **PCSX2**: verified identity, local inspection, and preview available;
  **no trusted provider yet, no apply**.
- **Dolphin**: verified identity, local inspection, and preview available;
  **no trusted provider yet, no apply**.
- **Mods**: not implemented in any form.

## Known limitations

- PCSX2 and Dolphin remain preview-only - no Install/Apply/Enable/
  Disable/Rollback control exists for either in the GUI.
- Mods are planned and not implemented; the Mods section of Cheats & Mods
  is a labelled placeholder.
- There is no cancellation once a shared-apply write has actually begun.
- Cheats & Mods does not yet use the shared scrollable-page keyboard
  wrapper (Page Up/Down/Home/End) that Settings, Doctor, About, Sources,
  Library Views, and History & Logs all share.
- Operation history in History & Logs remains in-memory for the current
  session; it is not yet persisted to disk.
- No general-purpose local or community cheat/mod import inspection
  pipeline exists; only the fixed, reviewed RetroArch trusted-source list
  can be fetched.

## Upgrade notes

- No config file format changes.
- No database schema migration action is required; the library database's
  schema version advanced to support new scan-summary counters, applied
  automatically on next open.
- All new on-disk state (identity cache, preview cache, apply journals,
  backups, catalogue snapshots) lives in new, additive paths under
  ArchiveFS's existing managed directories - nothing about an existing
  `v0.5.0-alpha` install needs to change before upgrading.
- If you have an existing RetroArch cheat-source cache from `v0.5.0-alpha`,
  it remains usable; the new Sources-page Download/Update workflow reuses
  the same cache root.

## Testing status

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`: clean.
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`: clean.
- `cargo test --workspace`: 1,499 tests passing as of this document (CLI
  127, core 907, GUI 465).
- Full line-by-line verification of the shared apply/rollback/preview/
  identity safety properties against their documentation was performed as
  part of the release audit - see `docs/V0.6_RELEASE_AUDIT.md` Section on
  core safety review.

## Manual QA still required

A real manual QA pass on Nobara against
[`docs/MANUAL_QA_v0.6.0-alpha.md`](MANUAL_QA_v0.6.0-alpha.md) has **not**
been recorded yet. This is a release blocker - see
[`docs/V0.6_RELEASE_AUDIT.md`](V0.6_RELEASE_AUDIT.md) for the full go/no-go
checklist.
