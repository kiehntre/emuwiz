# Platform artwork comparison

> **Completed review snapshot**
>
> This comparison records an earlier artwork review and is retained for provenance. It is not current product guidance; see the [README](../../README.md) for the current product view.

Audit of the platform artwork held in three places: this branch
(`feature/platform-artwork-completion`), the committed state of `main`, and the
**uncommitted working tree** of the protected main worktree at
`/home/davedap/archivefs`.

Nothing in the protected worktree was modified, staged, moved or copied to
produce this report. Every figure below comes from reading those files and from
`archivefs platform-artwork import-folder --dry-run`, pointed at a throwaway
`--root`, which wrote nothing.

**This report does not choose winners.** Where two images claim one platform,
both are described and the decision is left open — see
[Decisions needed](#decisions-that-need-a-human).

---

## 1. What is where

| Location | PNG | SVG | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `main` committed | 17 | 10 | The 10 SVGs are the closed category fallback set |
| Protected main worktree | 67 | 10 | 17 tracked PNG (12 of them modified) + **50 new untracked** |
| This branch | 17 | 10 | Same images as `main`, three **renamed** |

The branch adds **no new images**. Its three asset changes are pure renames,
content-identical (`R100`):

| Old name | New name | Canonical ID |
|---|---|---|
| `playstation.png` | `psx.png` | `PSX` |
| `playstation2.png` | `ps2.png` | `PS2` |
| `playstation3.png` | `ps3.png` | `PS3` |

So the branch is **wiring, not artwork**: a 1,066-line
`archivefs-core/src/platform_artwork.rs`, a `platform-artwork` CLI, a GUI
artwork manager, and the rename that makes three filenames match their canonical
IDs.

The 50 new images live **only** in the protected worktree. They are not on any
branch and would be lost by a `git clean` in that worktree.

---

## 2. The naming rule

Artwork resolves by exact filename stem, where the stem is the canonical
platform ID lowercased with non-alphanumerics removed:

```
"Acorn Archimedes" -> acornarchimedes.png
"PSX"              -> psx.png
"TurboGrafx-16"    -> turbografx16.png
```

There is no substring or fuzzy matching, by design. A filename that is not an
exact stem loads nothing at all — it is inert, not approximate.

---

## 3. Coverage against the canonical registry

74 canonical platforms. **31 have artwork; 43 do not.**

Recognised today (31): `acornarchimedes`, `amiga`, `amigacd32`, `amstradcpc`,
`arcade`, `atarijaguar`, `atarilynx`, `dreamcast`, `gameboy`, `gameboycolor`,
`gamecube`, `gamegear`, `megadrive`, `n64`, `neogeo`, `neogeopocket`, `nes`,
`psp`, `psx`, `saturn`, `sega32x`, `sharpx68000`, `snes`, `switch`, `vic20`,
`virtualboy`, `wii`, `wiiu`, `wonderswancolor`, `xbox`, `xbox360`.

### Canonical platforms with no artwork (43)

`3DO`, `Acorn Electron`, `Apple II`, `Atari 8-bit`, `Atari2600`, `Atari5200`,
`Atari7800`, `AtariST`, `BBC Micro`, `ColecoVision`, `Commodore 128`,
`Commodore 64`, `Commodore CDTV`, `DOS`, `FM Towns`, `Game Boy Advance`,
`Intellivision`, `MSX`, `MSX2`, `Macintosh`, `MasterSystem`, `NEC PC-8801`,
`NEC PC-9801`, `NGage`, `Neo Geo CD`, `Neo Geo Pocket Color`, `NeoGeo64`,
`Nintendo 3DS`, `Nintendo DS`, `PC`, `PC Engine`, `PC Engine CD`, `PC-98`,
`PS2`, `PS3`, `Philips CD-i`, `PlayStation Vita`, `ScummVM`, `Sega CD`,
`TurboGrafx-16`, `Vectrex`, `WonderSwan`, `ZX Spectrum`.

`PS2` and `PS3` appear here only because the protected worktree still holds the
pre-rename names; **this branch's rename fixes both**, taking the real gap to 41.

Many of the remaining 41 have a candidate image sitting in the worktree under a
name that does not load — see the next two sections. Correcting those names
would close roughly two thirds of the gap without drawing anything new.

---

## 4. Misspelled filenames

Nine files are one or two letters away from a canonical stem. Each currently
loads **nothing**; renaming makes each load immediately. High confidence.

| File in worktree | Intended stem | Canonical platform |
|---|---|---|
| `atrai7800.png` | `atari7800.png` | Atari7800 |
| `atria5200.png` | `atari5200.png` | Atari5200 |
| `atrii2600.png` | `atari2600.png` | Atari2600 |
| `commidore64.png` | `commodore64.png` | Commodore 64 |
| `dreamcatst.png` | `dreamcast.png` | Dreamcast |
| `philpscdi.png` | `philipscdi.png` | Philips CD-i |
| `supergratx.png` | `supergrafx` → alias | PC Engine |
| `turbogratx16.png` | `turbografx16.png` | TurboGrafx-16 |
| `turbogratxcd.png` | `turbografxcd` → alias | PC Engine CD |

`dreamcatst.png` is a special case: it is the **only** one of the 50 new images
with an alpha channel, and a correctly-named `dreamcast.png` already exists.
See [Decisions](#decisions-that-need-a-human).

---

## 5. Valid platforms under a non-canonical name

These name a real platform but not by its stem, so they are inert. Renaming is
mechanical, but two collide with artwork that already exists.

| File in worktree | Canonical platform | Correct stem | Collides? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `3DO Interactive Multiplayer.png` | 3DO | `3do.png` | no |
| `Archimedes.png` | Acorn Archimedes | `acornarchimedes.png` | **yes** — already present |
| `Atari ST.png` | AtariST | `atarist.png` | no |
| `ColecoVision.png` | ColecoVision | `colecovision.png` | no (case only) |
| `apple2.png` | Apple II | `appleii.png` | no |
| `bbcmodelb.png` | BBC Micro | `bbcmicro.png` | no |
| `electron.png` | Acorn Electron | `acornelectron.png` | no |
| `gba.png` | Game Boy Advance | `gameboyadvance.png` | no |
| `vita.png` | PlayStation Vita | `playstationvita.png` | no |

Renaming these eight (all but `Archimedes.png`) closes eight of the 41 gaps
outright.

---

## 6. Orphans — no canonical platform

These map to nothing in the registry. They load nothing today and renaming
alone cannot fix them; each needs either a registry addition or removal.

| File | Assessment |
|---|---|
| `psx2.png`, `psx3.png`, `psx4.png`, `psx5.png` | The canonical stems are `ps2`/`ps3`. `psx4`/`psx5` have no platform at all (no PS4/PS5 in the registry). |
| `4448b039-69a6-4690-a61f-dfc5393c3069.png` | A bare UUID. Almost certainly an accidental export artefact. |
| `3ds.png` | Platform exists as `Nintendo 3DS` → stem `nintendo3ds.png`. Renameable. |
| `neogeocolor.png` | Closest is `Neo Geo Pocket Color` → `neogeopocketcolor.png`. Ambiguous: may be intended as Neo Geo CD. |
| `scumvm.png` | Platform is `ScummVM` → `scummvm.png`. Misspelling **and** orphan. Renameable. |
| `spectrum128k.png` | Platform is `ZX Spectrum` → `zxspectrum.png`. The "128K" model distinction does not exist in the registry. |
| `pcfx.png` | No PC-FX in the registry. |
| `xboxone.png` | No Xbox One in the registry. |
| `pcbox.png` | Unclear — possibly "PC box art" or a typo for PC Engine. |
| `dragon.png` | Likely Dragon 32/64. Not in the registry. |
| `tandycomputer.png` | Likely TRS-80. Not in the registry. |
| `vc4000.png` | Interton VC 4000. Not in the registry. |

`3ds.png`, `scumvm.png` and `spectrum128k.png` are recoverable by rename and are
listed here only because the tool reports them as unrecognised as-is.

---

## 7. Exact overlaps

### 7.1 `psx.png` — a genuine collision

This is the one case where the branch and the protected worktree both hold a
file of the **same name with different content**.

| Source | SHA-256 (12) | Dimensions | Mode | Alpha | Bytes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Branch (renamed `playstation.png`) | `d53580a7f36b` | 1024×1024 | RGBA | **yes** | 1,575,183 |
| Protected worktree (untracked) | `8b7a940c9853` | 1024×1024 | RGB | no | 889,127 |

**This blocks a naive merge.** Bringing this branch into the main worktree would
have git create a tracked `psx.png` exactly where an untracked `psx.png` already
sits. Git will refuse ("untracked working tree files would be overwritten") or,
if forced, destroy a protected file. This must be settled *before* the branch
lands. See [Decisions](#decisions-that-need-a-human).

### 7.2 Duplicate claims on one platform

| Platform | Files claiming it |
|---|---|
| Acorn Archimedes | `acornarchimedes.png` (loads) + `Archimedes.png` (inert) |
| Dreamcast | `dreamcast.png` (loads, modified) + `dreamcatst.png` (inert, **has alpha**) |
| PSX | branch `psx.png` + worktree `psx.png` — see 7.1 |

### 7.3 Files unique to each side

- **Unique to the protected worktree:** all 50 new PNGs, plus the 12 modified
  tracked PNGs whose working-tree content differs from what is committed.
- **Unique to the branch:** `ps2.png` and `ps3.png` (names only — content is
  identical to `main`'s `playstation2.png` / `playstation3.png`).

---

## 8. Transparency — a consistent divergence

| Group | Count | Alpha | Mode |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Committed, untouched | 5 | **5 of 5** | RGBA |
| Committed, modified in worktree | 12 | 0 of 12 | RGB |
| New in worktree | 50 | 1 of 50 (`dreamcatst.png`) | 49 RGB, 1 RGBA |

Every image is 1024×1024, so dimensions are consistent throughout.

The original bundled style is **transparent RGBA**. The incoming batch is
**opaque RGB** — and it also *replaces* twelve images that previously had
transparency. Platform artwork is drawn as a texture centred in a row or shelf
slot over the panel background, so an opaque square renders as a visible tile
rather than a shape floating on the background, and it will not adapt between
light and dark themes.

This is a visual-design judgement, not a correctness one, and it is the single
largest open question in this audit. It is not something this review can settle.

---

## 9. Runtime behaviour (reviewed, no defects found)

- **Resolution** tries exact canonical ID, then case-insensitive display name,
  then the alias table — so both canonical IDs and aliases resolve.
- **Fallback chain**: per-game custom PNG → exact platform PNG (custom, then
  bundled) → category PNG → painted vector glyph. The last step always draws,
  so a missing image can never leave an empty slot.
- **Invalid images fail closed**: PNG extension enforced, file-size ceiling,
  decoder width/height/allocation limits, zero dimensions refused, symlinks
  rejected. Every failure returns a `Result` and falls through to the glyph.
- **Not repeatedly decoded**: entries are keyed by a file fingerprint, and a
  failed decode is cached as a negative result rather than retried each frame.
- **Cache bound**: `PlatformArtworkCache` has *no* eviction. It is bounded in
  practice by the number of artwork files present (≤74 platforms + 7
  categories), which is fine for platform artwork. Per-*game* artwork uses the
  same cache and is bounded only by how many game images the user has placed on
  disk — unlike the RomM cover cache, which has a hard 256-entry LRU bound.
  Worth noting, not currently a defect.
- **Game covers stay separate**: a RomM cover is drawn only when ready;
  otherwise the row falls back to platform artwork. The two never stack.
- **No network**: nothing in the platform artwork path opens a socket. The CLI
  states this explicitly and the import path is local-file only.

## 10. Decisions that need a human

1. **`psx.png` collision.** Ship the branch's transparent 1.5 MB RGBA image, or
   the worktree's opaque 889 KB RGB one? Nothing can merge safely until this is
   answered.
2. **Transparency direction.** Accept the opaque RGB batch as the new house
   style, or require alpha to match the five originals? This also decides
   whether the twelve modified images are an improvement or a regression.
3. **`dreamcatst.png`.** It is misspelled, but it is also the only new image
   with alpha, and a correctly-named `dreamcast.png` already exists. Rename it
   over the existing one, or discard it?
4. **`Archimedes.png`.** Duplicate of an existing, working `acornarchimedes.png`.
   Which image wins?
5. **Registry additions.** Should PC-FX, Xbox One, Dragon, TRS-80, VC 4000 and
   PS4/PS5 become canonical platforms? Until then their images cannot load.
6. **`4448b039-…png`.** Confirm this is an accident and can be dropped.
7. **`pcbox.png`, `neogeocolor.png`.** Ambiguous intent; the author should say
   what platform each depicts.
8. **Committing the artwork.** The 50 new images exist only as untracked files
   in one worktree. They are one `git clean` from gone and should be committed
   somewhere deliberately.

# Curation outcome (2026-08-05)

Applied under the approved decisions below. The protected main worktree was
not modified: every file was copied out of it, and its 64 dirty entries are
still exactly 64.

## Approved decisions applied

1. The transparent RGBA branch version of `psx.png` wins.
2. Transparent RGBA is the preferred platform-artwork style.
3. Opaque RGB artwork is **not** machine-stripped of its background.
4. `dreamcatst.png` excluded; `dreamcast.png` remains authoritative.
5. `Archimedes.png` excluded; `acornarchimedes.png` remains authoritative.
6. No registry additions (PC-FX, Xbox One, Dragon, TRS-80, VC 4000, PS4, PS5) in this PR.
7. `4448b039-…png` excluded as accidental.
8. `pcbox.png` and `neogeocolor.png` excluded as ambiguous.
9. All raw protected artwork backed up before any import.
10. Only assets with an unambiguous canonical mapping imported.

## Backup

`/home/davedap/archivefs-cleanup-backups/2026-08-05-platform-artwork-main/`

62 artwork files + `RETROARCH_ENV_DESIGN_DRAFT_v1.md` + `send-to-nobara.sh`,
with `SHA256SUMS.txt` (64 lines) and `IMAGE_REPORT.md`. Every file was verified
byte-for-byte against its source with `cmp` **before** any curation began.

## Imported: 33 files

**Canonical coverage: 31 → 50 of 74 platforms.**

## Deviations from the instructed rename list

Three instructed targets were checked against the registry before use and
**would not have loaded**. Artwork resolves by exact canonical stem, so a file
under a non-stem name is inert - it fails silently rather than visibly.

| Instructed | Problem | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vita.png` → `psvita.png` | `psvita` is not a stem. The registry proves `vita` → **PlayStation Vita**, stem `playstationvita`. | Imported as **`playstationvita.png`** |
| `supergratx.png` → `supergrafx.png` | `supergrafx` is not a stem; it is an *alias* for **PC Engine** (stem `pcengine`). | **Excluded** |
| `turbogratxcd.png` → `turbografxcd.png` | `turbografxcd` is not a stem; it is an *alias* for **PC Engine CD** (stem `pcenginecd`). | **Excluded** |

The two exclusions are not typos to correct but identity questions. Filing the
SuperGrafx image as `pcengine.png` asserts that a SuperGrafx logo represents the
PC Engine, and the TurboGrafx-CD image likewise carries US branding for what the
registry calls PC Engine CD. Both are plausible and neither is provable from the
registry, so under decision 10 they were left out for a human to settle.

Two conditional renames were confirmed and applied: `spectrum128k.png` →
`zxspectrum.png` (the registry resolves `ZX Spectrum 128K` to `ZX Spectrum`), and
`3ds.png` → `nintendo3ds.png` (`Nintendo 3DS` exists as a canonical ID with stem
`nintendo3ds`, and no other 3DS platform exists to confuse it with).

## Excluded, with reasons

| File | Reason |
|---|---|
| `dreamcatst.png` | Decision 4. Misspelling of an existing platform; `dreamcast.png` is authoritative. Note it was the only *transparent* image in the incoming batch. |
| `Archimedes.png` | Decision 5. Duplicate of the working `acornarchimedes.png`. |
| `4448b039-…png` | Decision 7. A bare UUID; accidental export artefact. |
| `pcbox.png` | Decision 8. Ambiguous - no clear platform. |
| `neogeocolor.png` | Decision 8. Ambiguous between Neo Geo Pocket Color and Neo Geo CD. |
| `psx.png` | Decision 1. The branch's transparent RGBA version wins; the opaque worktree version was not imported. |
| `psx2.png`, `psx3.png` | Wrong stem for PS2/PS3, which already ship artwork under `ps2.png` / `ps3.png`. |
| `psx4.png`, `psx5.png` | Decision 6. No PS4/PS5 in the registry. |
| `pcfx.png`, `xboxone.png`, `dragon.png`, `tandycomputer.png`, `vc4000.png` | Decision 6. No canonical platform; registry additions deferred. |
| `supergratx.png`, `turbogratxcd.png` | See deviations above - identity judgement required. |
| 12 modified tracked images | `dreamcast`, `gameboy`, `gamecube`, `megadrive`, `n64`, `saturn`, `snes`, `switch`, `wii`, `wiiu`, `xbox`, `xbox360`. Each committed version is transparent RGBA and each worktree replacement is opaque RGB. Per decision 2 and the instruction to preserve transparent existing artwork, the committed versions were kept. |

## Opaque artwork inventory (33 assets)

Every imported asset is 1024×1024 **opaque RGB**. The 17 pre-existing bundled
images are all transparent RGBA. Backgrounds were deliberately not stripped
(decision 3), so each import is correct in *identity* and pending in *style*.

These are listed in `OPAQUE_ARTWORK_PENDING_VISUAL_REVIEW` in the GUI. The
bundled-registry test enforces the queue in both directions: a non-listed asset
must be transparent, and a listed asset must still be opaque - so cleaning one
up forces its removal from the list, and the queue cannot quietly become stale.

### Assets requiring future visual/background cleanup

- `3do`, `acornelectron`, `amigacd32`, `amstradcpc`, `appleii`, `arcade`
- `atari2600`, `atari5200`, `atari7800`, `atarijaguar`, `atarilynx`, `atarist`
- `bbcmicro`, `colecovision`, `commodore64`, `gameboyadvance`, `gameboycolor`, `gamegear`
- `neogeo`, `neogeopocket`, `nes`, `nintendo3ds`, `philipscdi`, `playstationvita`
- `psp`, `scummvm`, `sega32x`, `sharpx68000`, `turbografx16`, `vic20`
- `virtualboy`, `wonderswancolor`, `zxspectrum`

## Remaining canonical platforms with no artwork (24 of 74)

`Atari 8-bit`, `Commodore 128`, `Commodore CDTV`, `DOS`, `FM Towns`, `Intellivision`, `MSX`, `MSX2`, `Macintosh`, `MasterSystem`, `NEC PC-8801`, `NEC PC-9801`, `NGage`, `Neo Geo CD`, `Neo Geo Pocket Color`, `NeoGeo64`, `Nintendo DS`, `PC`, `PC Engine`, `PC Engine CD`, `PC-98`, `Sega CD`, `Vectrex`, `WonderSwan`

`PC Engine` and `PC Engine CD` are only uncovered because the SuperGrafx and
TurboGrafx-CD images were held back pending the identity decision above.

## Registry additions deferred to a separate branch

Decision 6 keeps these out of this PR. Each has artwork waiting in the backup
that cannot load until the platform exists:

| Proposed platform | Artwork held in backup |
|---|---|
| PC-FX | `pcfx.png` |
| Xbox One | `xboxone.png` |
| Dragon 32/64 | `dragon.png` |
| TRS-80 / Tandy | `tandycomputer.png` |
| Interton VC 4000 | `vc4000.png` |
| PS4 | `psx4.png` |
| PS5 | `psx5.png` |

## Still needing a human

1. **SuperGrafx → PC Engine?** and **TurboGrafx-CD → PC Engine CD?** Approving
   either closes a coverage gap immediately.
2. **The opaque backlog.** 33 assets need backgrounds removing by hand, or a
   decision that opaque is acceptable.
3. **`pcbox.png` / `neogeocolor.png`.** The author should say what they depict.
4. **The 12 opaque replacements** for existing transparent images were kept out.
   If they are genuinely better artwork, they need transparency restoring first.
