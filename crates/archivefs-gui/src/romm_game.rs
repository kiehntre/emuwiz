//! The selected game's RomM identity: what RomM says about one local file, an
//! explicit hash verification, and its cover.
//!
//! # Provider-scoped
//!
//! Everything here describes RomM and only RomM. CheatBase evidence is not merged
//! in, and no verdict shown here claims to be EmuWiz's combined opinion of the
//! file - that belongs to a later stage. This panel answers one question: what does
//! the imported RomM catalogue say about the file selected in the Library?
//!
//! # Nothing happens because a panel opened
//!
//! Opening the panel reads the published cache and `symlink_metadata`. It does not
//! hash, does not contact RomM, and does not write. Hashing happens when someone
//! presses Verify local file; a cover is fetched when someone presses Show cover.
//! Both are single, explicit, cancellable actions.
//!
//! # Ambiguity is shown, never resolved by picking the first
//!
//! When several RomM records translate to the same local file, the verdict is
//! Ambiguous and every claimant is listed. Choosing one is a person's decision,
//! recorded in the panel, and it still does not overwrite anything EmuWiz
//! determined for itself.
//!
//! # Confirmed means hashed
//!
//! The six verdicts keep their exact meanings. In particular `Strong` is drawn as
//! Strong: RomM published hashes but this file has not been read, so nothing has
//! been compared. Only an explicit verification whose comparison agreed produces
//! Confirmed.
