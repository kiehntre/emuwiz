//! The Repair Review page.
//!
//! Loads a saved whole-library [`LibraryRepairPlan`] (the exact JSON the
//! CLI's `repair scan --plan-out` / `repair plan --plan` contract produces),
//! summarises its [`ReportCounts`], renders its proposals as a filterable,
//! selectable, virtualised list, and can apply a user-selected subset of the
//! Safe proposals.
//!
//! # No mutation except through the trusted backend
//!
//! This module never calls `std::fs::rename` or any other filesystem
//! mutation directly, and never builds or executes its own [`RepairPlan`].
//! The only mutation path is [`apply_saved_plan_selected`], invoked on a
//! background thread with the exact `LibraryRepairPlan` this page loaded
//! from disk: that function re-runs the authoritative scan, fully re-proves
//! the *entire* saved plan against it, resolves the selected ids against the
//! freshly proven plan only, and executes through the existing
//! transaction/journal/reverify machinery. This page never weakens, skips,
//! or duplicates any of that — it only supplies the saved plan, the selected
//! ids, and the trusted scan inputs recorded on the plan itself, and renders
//! whatever the backend returns.
//!
//! [`RepairPlan`]: archivefs_core::repair::plan::RepairPlan
//!
//! # Rows come from the backend, verbatim
//!
//! The row view-model ([`build_rows`]) is a pure presentation adapter:
//! Safe rows come directly from `plan.repair_plan.proposals`, NeedsReview
//! rows from `plan.report.needs_review`, and Blocked rows from
//! `plan.report.blocked`. It never infers or recalculates safety, never
//! reclassifies, and never builds a second planner. Ordering is deterministic
//! and fixed: Safe -> NeedsReview -> Blocked for the All filter, each bucket
//! in the backend's own order.
//!
//! # Do not render a plan twice, or scan in-GUI
//!
//! Loading a plan never re-runs a scan, preflight, or re-proof. That is a
//! deliberate later step.
