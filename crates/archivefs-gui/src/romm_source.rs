//! The RomM identity source card, and the shape of its operations.
//!
//! # Why there is a view model
//!
//! The card shows about thirty numbers and a dozen conditional labels, and the
//! properties that matter most about it are negative ones: a token must never
//! appear, a failed operation must never erase the counts that were there before,
//! and a sample import must never be presented as readiness. Those are hard to
//! test by poking at rendered pixels and easy to test as data.
//!
//! So [`RommCardView`] is built from authoritative state by a pure function, and
//! [`show_romm_source_card`] only draws it. The tests assert on the view model,
//! plus a real headless render to prove the drawing carries no secret.
//!
//! # What this slice does not do
//!
//! Configuration, mappings, record browsing, conflicts, the stale-summary view and
//! the identity panel all belong to later slices. Their buttons are present and
//! visibly disabled with an honest label, because a card that silently lacks them
//! is harder to understand than one that says what is coming.
