//! The Home page: "What would you like to do?"
//!
//! # Why this page exists
//!
//! Every one of the seven workflows here already shipped on its own page.
//! What was missing was a single place that names them as tasks, in plain
//! language, and says honestly whether each one looks ready, not yet set
//! up, or currently unavailable. Nothing on this page is a new capability -
//! it is a front door onto capabilities that already exist.
//!
//! # The view model, and why some cards say "not checked yet"
//!
//! Following `romm_source`/`cheat_sources_page`, authoritative state is
//! turned into a [`HomeView`] by the pure [`build_home_view`], and the
//! drawing code only draws. `main.rs` builds [`HomeInputs`] from whatever
//! is already loaded on `ArchiveFsApp` - never from a fresh read.
//!
//! Three of the seven cards (Cheats & Mods' source count, DAT Sources'
//! registry count, RomM's provider state) read state that EmuWiz
//! deliberately does not load until the user visits that page - loading it
//! eagerly here would mean opening Home always triggers three background
//! reads nobody asked for, network-shaped or not. So when the real page
//! has not been visited yet this session, [`CardReadiness::Unknown`] is
//! shown - "open it to check" - rather than guessing, or lying that
//! nothing is configured.
