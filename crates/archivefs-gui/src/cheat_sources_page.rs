//! The Cheat Sources page: the nine registered sources, made visible and
//! editable.
//!
//! # Why this page exists
//!
//! The registry, its priorities and its per-platform overrides have all
//! shipped for a while, reachable only from `archivefs cheat-source …` -
//! and per-platform participation was reachable only by hand-editing
//! `~/.config/archivefs/cheat_sources.toml`. Everything here surfaces
//! behaviour that already exists. Nothing on this page adds a field to that
//! file, and nothing changes how it is resolved.
//!
//! # The view model
//!
//! Following `romm_source`, authoritative state is turned into
//! [`CheatSourcesPageView`] by a pure function and the drawing code only
//! draws. The properties worth testing here are about *what is said* -
//! that a disabled source is still listed and still in its resolved
//! position, that an entry this build cannot act on is shown rather than
//! hidden, that nothing claims the upstream content was reviewed - and
//! those are data questions, answerable without a frame buffer.
//!
//! # Two registries, on purpose
//!
//! [`CheatSourcesPageState`] holds a `saved` registry and a `draft` one.
//! Edits touch the draft; the file is written only when the user saves. The
//! difference between the two *is* the unsaved-change state, so "is this
//! dirty?" cannot drift from "would saving change anything?" - they are the
//! same comparison.
