//! Cover artwork for the Gamer View game list.
//!
//! # Why this exists separately from the Details panel's cover
//!
//! The Details panel loads exactly one cover, on an explicit button press, through
//! [`RommOperation`](crate::RommOperation). That queue holds one operation at a
//! time and *drops* anything asked for while something else runs
//! (`start_romm_operation` returns `false`), because it also carries imports and
//! hash verifications, which must not overlap. A scrolling list of games needs many
//! covers at once and must never block a mount behind a thumbnail, so it cannot use
//! that queue - which is precisely why Gamer View drew platform icons and never a
//! RomM cover.
//!
//! Nothing here is a second downloader or a second image cache. Fetching,
//! validation, thumbnailing, bounding and on-disk storage all remain
//! [`archivefs_core::identity_source::artwork::ArtworkCache`]'s job, and decoding
//! remains [`crate::romm_game::decode_thumbnail`]'s. What this module adds is the
//! scheduling a list needs: which records to ask about, in what order, how many at
//! once, and how to hold the answers so scrolling back does not ask again.
//!
//! # Only RomM's own artwork
//!
//! The same rule the core enforces applies here and is checked again before a
//! request is made: only `path_cover_small`, a path on the approved RomM instance,
//! is ever fetched. `url_cover` points at IGDB or RetroAchievements and is recorded
//! for provenance only - a record carrying nothing else resolves to
//! [`NoCover::PublicOnly`] and draws the placeholder without any request being
//! made.
//!
//! # Answers belong to records, not to rows
//!
//! `egui`'s `show_rows` reuses row positions as the list scrolls, so anything
//! stored per row index would eventually be drawn beside a different game. Every
//! answer here is keyed by the record's own local path and carries the
//! `provider_game_id` it was resolved for; a row draws a cover only when both match
//! the record it is drawing. A reply for a library generation that has since been
//! replaced is discarded rather than stored.
