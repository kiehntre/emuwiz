//! One shared, read-only diagnostic finding model for Doctor.
//!
//! EmuWiz already contains a large diagnostic engine, but every
//! subsystem grew its own finding type, its own severity scale, and its own
//! UI surface. This module adds exactly one thing:
//! a shared [`Finding`] plus thin adapters that translate the *existing*
//! reports into it. It rewrites no check and owns no check of its own.
//!
//! ## Read-only contract
//!
//! Stage 1A is strictly diagnostic. Nothing here repairs, and nothing here
//! mutates. The contract is split deliberately into two halves so the
//! guarantee is provable rather than asserted:
//!
//! - **Gatherers** ([`assess_mount_root_safety`], and the callers'
//!   existing `diagnose_database` / `discover_shared_apply_history` /
//!   `list_source_folder_views_at` calls) perform bounded, read-only I/O. Each
//!   underlying function already documents that it creates nothing - see
//!   `database::diagnose_database`'s "without creating files/directories,
//!   running migrations, changing pragmas, checkpointing WAL, or attempting
//!   recovery", and `patch_manager::destination_safety`'s module doc "never
//!   creates a directory or file".
//!
//!   `run_setup_diagnostics` is deliberately **not** among them: its "Mount
//!   root is writable" check probes by creating and removing a file, which
//!   changes the mount root's modification time. Callers pass a
//!   `SetupDiagnostics` they already computed elsewhere instead, so opening
//!   Doctor never performs that write.
//! - **The runner** ([`runner::run_doctor_scan`]) is a *pure function* over
//!   already-gathered inputs. It performs no I/O at all - no filesystem, no
//!   process, no network. `runner.rs` is guarded by a source-level test
//!   (`runner_source_contains_no_io_or_mutation_calls`) in addition to the
//!   behavioural before/after tests.
//!
//! ## What this module is deliberately not
//!
//! - Not a repair dispatcher. [`KnownRecovery`] is *informational metadata*
//!   describing a repair the user can already perform somewhere else in
//!   EmuWiz today. It carries no callable, no closure, and no path to
//!   execute against.
//! - Not a replacement for `DoctorReport`, `SetupDiagnostics`,
//!   `HealthIssue`, `DatabaseHealthReport`, or
//!   `emulator_environment::retroarch::Diagnostic`. All of them stay
//!   exactly as they are; these adapters read them.
//! - Not a claim of complete coverage. [`DEFERRED_CHECKS`] names, in the
//!   product itself, every check Stage 1A does not perform, so a clean scan
//!   can never be presented as "everything is fine".
