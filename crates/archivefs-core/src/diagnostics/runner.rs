//! The read-only Doctor runner.
//!
//! # This file is deliberately pure
//!
//! [`run_doctor_scan`] is a pure function over already-gathered inputs. It
//! performs no filesystem access, starts no process, opens no database, and
//! makes no network request. Everything it needs was collected by the
//! caller before it was invoked.
//!
//! That is not merely a convention here - it is checked. The test
//! `runner_source_contains_no_io_or_mutation_calls` reads this file's own
//! source and fails if it mentions `fs::`, `File`, `Command`, `ureq`,
//! `create_dir`, `remove_file`, `remove_dir`, `scan_archives`, or
//! `refresh`. If a future change needs any of those, it belongs in a
//! gatherer in the parent module, not here.
//!
//! # Why gathering is separate
//!
//! Splitting gathering from evaluation buys three things at once:
//!
//! - the no-mutation guarantee becomes provable rather than asserted;
//! - the runner is trivially testable with hand-built inputs, so the
//!   adapter and ordering tests need no temporary directories at all;
//! - a subsystem whose input is unavailable is reported honestly as
//!   *unavailable* instead of quietly contributing zero findings, which
//!   would look identical to "checked and clean".
