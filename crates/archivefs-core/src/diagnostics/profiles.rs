//! Read-only writability assessment for discovered emulator profiles.
//!
//! Doctor already knows which profiles exist: `discover_dolphin_profiles`,
//! `discover_pcsx2_profiles`, `discover_xenia_profiles`,
//! `discover_ppsspp_profiles` and `discover_duckstation_profiles` do that,
//! and each already reports its own blockers. This module answers the one
//! question none of them answers: **could EmuWiz write an install into that
//! profile?**
//!
//! It answers it from metadata only. Nothing here creates a directory, a
//! `GameSettings` file, a `.pnach`, a `.patch.toml`, a config file or a probe
//! file, and nothing changes a permission bit. The strongest verdict available
//! is therefore [`WritabilityAssessment::AppearsWritable`] - see that type for
//! why "writable: yes" is never claimed.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! Only the adapters EmuWiz already supports, through their existing
//! discovery abstractions. No emulator gains support here. Flatpak profiles
//! are assessed exactly like native ones, which is honest but incomplete: a
//! portal can still refuse a write that the bits allow, so the narrowed
//! deferred entry in `DEFERRED_CHECKS` says so.
//!
//! PPSSPP and DuckStation are assessed the same read-only way as every other
//! adapter here, but - like Xenia - never become
//! [`managed_scan_targets`]: neither has an in-file EmuWiz ownership marker
//! (a managed block/section) to scan for, since neither has install/cheat-
//! write support yet.
