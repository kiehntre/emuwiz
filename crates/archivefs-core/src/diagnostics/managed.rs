//! Read-only detection of EmuWiz-managed cheat and patch entries that can
//! no longer be accounted for.
//!
//! # What proves ownership on this build
//!
//! This check never guesses. An entry is only ever treated as EmuWiz's if
//! one of exactly two things proves it:
//!
//! 1. **An install journal.** `SharedApplyJournal` is a complete ownership
//!    record: the adapter, the selected archive, the verified game identity,
//!    the profile, the exact destination file, and the digest of what was
//!    written. Every adapter is covered this way, because every install goes
//!    through the shared transaction.
//! 2. **An adapter's own in-file marker.** PCSX2 uses
//!    `// ArchiveFS managed block: <id>` … `// End ArchiveFS managed block`.
//!    The integrated Dolphin GameHacking provider uses the explicit
//!    `[ArchiveFS_Managed_GameHacking]` section. Both are parsed by the same
//!    existing readers used by their installers.
//!
//! Xenia `.patch.toml` and RetroArch `.cht` files carry **no** EmuWiz
//! marker on this build. That means a managed entry whose journal has been
//! deleted is undetectable for those adapters, and this module says so
//! rather than pretending otherwise - see the narrowed deferred entry in
//! `DEFERRED_CHECKS`. Inventing a marker here would be worse than useless: it
//! would risk classifying a user's own codes as EmuWiz's.
//!
//! # What is never reported
//!
//! - A user's own Gecko, Action Replay, PNACH or Xenia entry. Without one of
//!   the two ownership proofs above, an entry is simply not EmuWiz's, and
//!   is left entirely alone.
//! - An empty managed section. `[Gecko_Enabled]` with nothing in it, or a
//!   `.pnach` with no managed blocks left, is the normal result of a
//!   successful uninstall. That is not damage and produces no finding.
//!
//! # Read-only
//!
//! Journals and managed files are read with bounded reads; nothing is opened
//! for writing, no directory is walked outside a discovered profile
//! destination, no symlink is followed, no game image is read, no emulator is
//! launched, and nothing contacts a network.
