//! The single authoritative platform registry.
//!
//! Every piece of platform knowledge this build has lives in [`PLATFORMS`]:
//! canonical identifier, display name, folder and filename aliases, strong and
//! shared extensions, bounded magic-byte signatures, multi-file layout
//! evidence, conflicting platforms and the explanation shown to a person. The
//! GUI, the CLI and the core scanner all read from here - none of them keeps a
//! second list that can drift.
//!
//! # Canonical identifiers are stable
//!
//! [`Platform::id`] is what gets written to `platform_assignments.platform` in
//! the database, so these strings are a storage contract and are never renamed
//! casually. Where two identifiers describe what is arguably one machine -
//! `PC Engine` and `TurboGrafx-16`, or `PC-98` and `NEC PC-9801` - both are
//! kept and related through [`equivalent_platform_ids`] rather than merged,
//! because merging them would silently rewrite what users already have stored.
//!
//! # Matching is exact, on whole path components
//!
//! Aliases are stored already normalised (ASCII alphanumerics, lowercased -
//! see [`normalize_alias`]), so `"ZX Spectrum"`, `"zx-spectrum"`, `"zx_spectrum"`
//! and `"zxspectrum"` all key to the same entry without separate rows. Matching
//! is **exact against one whole normalised path component** and never a
//! substring: that is what keeps `bbc`, `cpc`, `mac` and `dos` safe as aliases,
//! and what stops a real library's `zx-spectrum-next`, `segacd32`, `amiga-cd`
//! and `atari-jaguar-cd` folders from being mistaken for the shorter platforms
//! whose names they contain.
//!
//! # Extensions are ranked, never trusted alone
//!
//! [`Platform::strong_extensions`] are format-specific enough to carry a
//! detection on their own. [`Platform::weak_extensions`] are shared - `.bin`,
//! `.iso`, `.cue`, `.dsk`, `.tap`, `.zip` and friends - and can only ever
//! narrow a decision, never make one. See [`SHARED_EXTENSIONS`].
