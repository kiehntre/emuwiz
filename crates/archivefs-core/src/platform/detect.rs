//! Evidence-based platform detection.
//!
//! Detection answers three questions, not one: *which* platform, *how sure*,
//! and *on what evidence*. A caller that only wants the first can use
//! [`PlatformDetectionReport::platform`], but the confidence and the evidence
//! are always computed, because a confident-looking wrong answer is worse than
//! an honest "unknown".
//!
//! # Priority
//!
//! Evidence is ranked by [`DetectionSource`], strongest first:
//!
//! 1. An explicit user assignment.
//! 2. Existing trusted platform metadata.
//! 3. An exact normalised folder alias.
//! 4. A bounded file signature.
//! 5. A distinctive multi-file layout.
//! 6. Emulator or profile context.
//! 7. A strong, platform-specific extension.
//! 8. A weak, shared extension.
//!
//! A weaker source never overrides a stronger contradictory one. That single
//! rule is what fixes the ScummVM `RESOURCE.GEN` misclassification: an
//! extension (rank 8) cannot displace the folder that contains it (rank 3).
//!
//! # Read-only and bounded
//!
//! The only filesystem access is `symlink_metadata`, one `read_dir` of the
//! containing directory when layout evidence is requested, and at most
//! [`MAX_MAGIC_READ_BYTES`](super::MAX_MAGIC_READ_BYTES) bytes read at a known
//! offset from the file itself. Nothing is written, no archive is opened or
//! extracted, no image is parsed or hashed, no process is spawned and no
//! network request is made.
