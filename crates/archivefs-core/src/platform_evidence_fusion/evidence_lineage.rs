//! Batch 19: source-lineage / provenance foundation.
//!
//! # The thesis every future adapter must obey
//!
//! **Observation != Channel != UpstreamSource.**
//!
//! - An [`EvidenceObservation`] is one fact returned/read at one time.
//! - An [`EvidenceChannel`] is *how EmuWiz received* that fact (Hasheous,
//!   RomM, a locally parsed DAT, a locally parsed byte header, ...).
//! - A [`SourceFamily`] is the underlying preservation corpus the fact is
//!   *actually about* (No-Intro, TOSEC, Redump, ...).
//!
//! A channel is never itself a source. Hasheous and RomM are relays: they
//! forward facts that are really about No-Intro, Redump, TOSEC, WHDLoad,
//! MAME, etc. Six channels repeating one upstream source must remain
//! representable as six observations grouped under **one** upstream
//! lineage - never inflated into six independent votes. See
//! [`merge_evidence`] and [`AgreementStatus::SameSourceAgreement`].
//!
//! Genuinely independent evidence lanes (a structural byte-header detector
//! plus a real No-Intro hash match) must still be classifiable as real
//! independent agreement ([`AgreementStatus::IndependentAgreement`]).
//! Derived/relay relationships (MAMERedump derived from Redump) are
//! distinguished from independence, so a disagreement between a direct
//! source and its own derivative reads as "stale derivative / mapping
//! drift" ([`AgreementStatus::DerivedSourceConflict`]), not "two
//! preservation authorities disagree"
//! ([`AgreementStatus::IndependentSourceConflict`]).
//!
//! # What this module is not
//!
//! This is architecture, not integration. Nothing here calls a network,
//! fabricates a DAT match, changes [`crate::platform_evidence_fusion`]'s
//! existing content-fusion behavior, or touches library planning /
//! transaction execution in any way. It exists *alongside*
//! [`crate::platform_evidence_fusion::combined_identity`] and
//! [`crate::dat::identity`], which remain fully unchanged; a handful of
//! pure `observation_from_*` bridge functions turn their already-existing
//! output into lineage-aware observations without altering how those
//! modules compute anything.
//!
//! # No numeric voting
//!
//! There is deliberately no `observations.len()`-as-confidence anywhere in
//! this module's public API. [`independent_source_group_count`] exists
//! specifically so "how many observations exist" and "how many
//! *independent upstream families* agree" are never the same question -
//! see `tests::independent_source_group_count_is_not_observation_count`.
