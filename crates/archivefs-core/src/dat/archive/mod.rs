//! Bounded archive-member evidence for read-only DAT audits.
//!
//! The smallest reusable shape needed for member-aware DAT verification
//! across archive formats. It is intentionally narrow: one source trait that
//! enumerates members in deterministic order and yields per-member hashed
//! evidence, plus the evidence/status/error types. It does **not** define a
//! DAT-verification engine — members are hashed here; matching against a DAT
//! stays a separate consumer (`DatIndex`/`audit_one`).
//!
//! # Determinism and safety invariants
//!
//! - Members are enumerated in the archive's own deterministic order; nothing
//!   ever picks a member "by position" as a winner.
//! - Hashing is bounded, chunked, and cancellable. Each format decides whether
//!   it can continue after a member refusal: ZIP members are independent,
//!   while a solid 7z stream may have to stop. The returned pass outcome says
//!   explicitly whether every member was examined.
//! - Nested archives are surfaced (with [`ArchiveMemberStatus::NestedArchive`])
//!   but never recursively opened or hashed.
