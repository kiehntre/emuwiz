//! A persistent registry of local DAT sources.
//!
//! Until now a DAT was a path typed on the command line: parsed once, reported
//! on, and forgotten (`dat/parsers/mod.rs` documents that deliberate CLI
//! exception). This module is the other half - a place to *keep* a DAT source,
//! so it can be named, enabled, assigned a platform, validated, and audited
//! from the GUI without retyping a path every time.
//!
//! # Separate from cheat sources, on purpose
//!
//! DAT sources live in their own file (`~/.config/archivefs/dat_sources.toml`)
//! and their own priority space. The two answer different questions - "which
//! catalogue is authoritative for this game's *identity*?" versus "which
//! catalogue provides its *cheats*?" - so a single ordering would be
//! meaningless, and a single file would have to be read by every build that
//! only understands one of them.
//!
//! Sharing `cheat_sources.toml` was considered and rejected: that file is
//! `deny_unknown_fields`, so adding any key to it makes it unreadable by every
//! already-released binary. A new file has no such constraint, and this one is
//! built from the start to keep what it does not understand (see
//! [`config`]).
//!
//! # What is policy and what is not
//!
//! Everything a user chose - the ID, the path, enabled state, platform,
//! priority - is policy and is persisted. Health is *runtime state*: it records
//! what a validation run observed. It is persisted too, because re-parsing
//! every registered DAT on page open would be worse, but it is always presented
//! with the time it was taken and, for file sources, with a marker when the file
//! has changed since (see [`DatSourceHealth::is_stale_for`]).
//!
//! # Nothing here writes to a DAT or a ROM
//!
//! This module reads DAT files and writes exactly one thing: its own
//! preferences file, through the shared durable-write path. Removing a source
//! removes a registry entry and nothing else.
