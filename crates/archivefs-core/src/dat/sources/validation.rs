//! Path policy, folder discovery, and read-only validation for DAT sources.
//!
//! # Why registered paths get a policy the CLI's do not
//!
//! `dat/parsers/mod.rs` explains why a DAT path typed on the command line does
//! not go through `safe_read`: the person running the command chose it, so
//! confining it to the configured source folders would refuse the ordinary case
//! while protecting against nothing. That module also says exactly when the
//! exception stops applying — "the moment a DAT path arrives from
//! configuration, a manifest or any other stored source".
//!
//! This is that moment. A registered path is read again on every validation and
//! every audit, long after whoever typed it has stopped watching, so it gets a
//! policy:
//!
//! - absolute, with no `.` or `..` component;
//! - not a filesystem root;
//! - no component of it may be a symlink, and neither may the target;
//! - it must be the kind of thing it was registered as - a file source that has
//!   become a directory is refused rather than quietly scanned.
//!
//! Note what this is *not*: it is not `TrustedRoots` confinement. DAT files
//! normally live wherever they were downloaded rather than inside a ROM source
//! folder, so confining them there would refuse almost every real DAT. The
//! symlink rules are what the safety model actually needs here, and they are
//! the same ones [`crate::safe_read`] applies with [`crate::safe_read::TrustedRoots::none`].
//!
//! # Folder sources are one level deep, deliberately
//!
//! A folder source scans its own directory and no deeper. Recursion is not
//! merely unbounded-by-default; it is the wrong shape for the thing being
//! modelled - a DAT folder is a flat drop of `.dat` files, and recursing would
//! reach into unrelated trees a user pointed near, not at. Nested collections
//! are supported by registering each folder, which keeps what is scanned equal
//! to what was chosen.
//!
//! # Nothing here modifies a DAT file
//!
//! Every filesystem call in this module is `read_dir`, `symlink_metadata`,
//! `metadata`, or a read-only open. There is no create, write, rename, remove,
//! or permission change anywhere in it.
