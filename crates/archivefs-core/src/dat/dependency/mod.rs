//! Read-only, fail-closed dependency vocabulary for set completeness (Stage 2d).
//!
//! Stage 2c ([`crate::dat::set`]) answers one question: *are this set's own
//! declared physical storage members present?* It deliberately excludes
//! borrowed members from `members_required`, surfaces a CHD's
//! `parent_required()` without chasing it, and never looks at `cloneof`,
//! `romof`, `device_ref`, `biosset`, or `sampleof` at all.
//!
//! Stage 2d answers the separate question: *are this set's required dependency
//! relationships satisfied, without ever manufacturing a false `Complete`?*
//!
//! # The two layers never merge
//!
//! ```text
//! direct storage state  (Stage 2c, per archive)
//!   +  dependency state (Stage 2d, per collection)
//!   =  final SetState
//! ```
//!
//! The combine is [`apply_dependency_state`] and it is **downgrade-only**: a
//! set that Stage 2c did not call `Complete` is returned unchanged, so no
//! amount of dependency success can ever promote an `Incomplete`,
//! `BadMetadata`, or `NeedsReview` storage verdict. That direction is asserted
//! exhaustively in this module's tests and is the single most important
//! property of the whole stage.
//!
//! # Distinct concepts stay distinct
//!
//! The eight [`DependencyKind`]s exist because these relationships overlap in
//! practice but are *not* the same statement, and collapsing any pair of them
//! is a documented route to a false `Complete`:
//!
//! - `cloneof` is a hierarchy claim; `romof` is a ROM-source claim. A set may
//!   do either, both (at the same or different targets), or neither. Neither
//!   is ever synthesised from the other.
//! - A `merge=` attribute is a *member-level* borrow of one named declaration
//!   in the provider set. It is never satisfied by an unrelated same-named
//!   member elsewhere in the catalogue.
//! - A BIOS relationship is storage provision. It is **not** a claim that any
//!   particular runtime BIOS selection is runnable; see
//!   [`BIOS_RUNTIME_SELECTION_NOT_MODELLED`].
//! - `device_ref` is a device requirement, not ROM borrowing.
//! - Samples live in their own namespace and are never satisfied by a ROM.
//! - A CHD header's `parent_sha1` is a format-level delta dependency. It is
//!   **not** the DAT's `disk merge=`, and the two are resolved independently.
//!
//! # Fail-closed is the whole design
//!
//! Every resolution answers with a [`DependencyOutcome`], and only
//! [`DependencyOutcome::Satisfied`] permits `Complete`. Missing, ambiguous,
//! cyclic, contradictory, unsupported, and not-yet-observable all block it.
//! False `Incomplete` is an accepted cost; false `Complete` is not.
//!
//! # Interaction with the known disk-only-set emission gap
//!
//! [`crate::dat::set::classify_archive_sets`] still seeds set membership from
//! ROM verdicts only, so a catalogue entry declaring `<disk>`s and no `<rom>`s
//! is never emitted as a [`SetResolution`] at all. That gap is inherited
//! here, and this stage deliberately does not paper over it: a set that is
//! never emitted is never dependency-resolved either, which is silent absence
//! rather than a false verdict - exactly the behaviour an untouched ROM-only
//! set already has.
//!
//! Two consequences worth stating, because they are easy to misread as bugs:
//!
//! - A **disk-only provider** can still satisfy a dependency. Resolution
//!   consumes [`crate::dat::disk_audit`] evidence for the whole run, not the
//!   emitted resolution list, so a borrowed disk or a parent CHD living in a
//!   disk-only set resolves normally. Only the provider's *own* resolution is
//!   missing from the output.
//! - Closing the gap later is additive. Disk-seeded membership would emit more
//!   [`SetResolution`]s; each would flow through this stage unchanged, because
//!   nothing here reads the resolution list to decide what evidence exists.
//!   No dependency rule needs revisiting when that follow-up lands.
