//! Rollback of applied rename transactions.
//!
//! Rollback reverses only entries the filesystem confirmed as Applied, in the
//! reverse order they were applied. Every step re-verifies that the destination
//! is still the recorded object and that the original source path is free,
//! renames back with the no-clobber primitive, and confirms the source is
//! restored before marking the entry RolledBack. A rollback that cannot meet
//! those checks stops and reports - it never claims a full rollback for a
//! partial one, and a repeated rollback request is a safe no-op for entries
//! already rolled back. Cancellation stops the loop with any not-yet-reversed
//! Applied entries left untouched (and retryable); it is an incomplete
//! rollback, never reported as a full one.
