//! Safe, gated application of explicitly approved rename plans, with durable
//! transaction journaling and rollback.
//!
//! This is the apply side of the read-only rename planning (PR #14). It may
//! rename a file **only** when every gate holds:
//!
//! - the proposal comes from the current validated rename plan generation;
//! - the proposal is `Suggested`, actionable, collision-free, and explicitly
//!   approved by the user;
//! - at apply time the source is still the very same regular file that was
//!   reviewed (same size and, where supported, same inode/device; never a
//!   symlink);
//! - the destination does not exist, shares the source's directory, and lies
//!   inside the configured trusted roots;
//! - every preflight check passes immediately before the rename.
//!
//! # The hard safety boundary
//!
//! The executor is the **only** place renames happen; the GUI never calls
//! `std::fs::rename`. Mutations use a no-clobber primitive
//! (`renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)` on Linux) so an existing destination is
//! never overwritten, there is no copy+delete fallback, and a destination that
//! appears between preflight and rename is refused atomically. A batch is
//! journaled durably before the first mutation and updated after every
//! transition, so a crash leaves a recoverable record. Nothing here runs
//! unattended, retries a failed mutation, or resumes automatically.
//!
//! # Unsupported cases
//!
//! Symlink sources, broken symlinks, directories, archive members, cross-
//! directory or cross-filesystem moves, overwrites, and any rename outside the
//! trusted roots are never performed. On platforms without a verified
//! no-clobber primitive (everything but Linux in this build) the executor
//! refuses to mutate rather than risk a TOCTOU-prone exists+rename sequence.
