//! The gated transaction executor: the only place renames happen.
//!
//! The executor turns an explicitly approved subset of a rename plan into a
//! journal-backed transaction, preflights the whole batch, journals it durably
//! **before** mutating anything, then applies entries one at a time - each one
//! freshly preflighted, renamed with a no-clobber primitive, and confirmed by
//! the filesystem before it is marked Applied. Nothing here runs unattended;
//! it never retries a failed mutation, and a failure stops the batch.
//!
//! # Build and apply are separate layers
//!
//! [`build_transaction`] captures each approved source's identity **at review
//! time** (when the user previews the batch). [`apply_transaction`] then
//! preflights everything again **immediately before** each rename, so a hostile
//! change between review and apply - a different inode, a symlink substitution,
//! a resized file, an appearing destination - is caught. The GUI never calls
//! `std::fs::rename`; this module owns every mutation.
