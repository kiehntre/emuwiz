//! Pure DAT-source-level platform/machine identity resolution.
//!
//! A DAT catalogue's own platform is a different question from a game's
//! platform: this module answers "what platform does this whole DAT file
//! describe", not "what platform is this ROM". [`crate::platform::identity`]
//! resolves the latter, across RomM and verified-DAT evidence, and already
//! assumes a DAT source's platform is known; this module is what a later
//! chunk will use to derive that fact from a DAT's own content instead of
//! requiring a person to assign it by hand first.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! This module defines the identity model, its pure resolver, and pure
//! evidence gathering from an already-parsed [`ParsedDat`] (via
//! [`gather_dat_platform_evidence`]/[`identify_dat_source`]). It is still not
//! wired into DAT validation, audit, repair, source assignment, rename
//! planning/apply, RomM, persistence, or the GUI - it only proves that real
//! parsed DAT facts can reach the resolver and produce an honest answer.
//! Nothing here performs filesystem, database, or network I/O: gathering
//! operates only on the `DatSource`/[`DatGameEntry`] values a parser already
//! produced, including plain string manipulation of `DatSource::file_path`
//! (never a read of the path itself).
//!
//! # Only `Strong` evidence resolves anything
//!
//! In this first chunk, a single [`DatPlatformEvidence`] at
//! [`DatPlatformConfidence::Strong`] is what a `Resolved` or `Ambiguous`
//! outcome is built from. `Corroborated` and `Weak` evidence is always kept
//! in a `Resolved` outcome's `evidence` list for provenance, and never
//! silently downgrades a Strong result, but it can never resolve an identity
//! or create an `Ambiguous` outcome by itself - matching the established
//! rule that a filename or a media extension is never authority on its own.
//! A later chunk, once real evidence-gathering exists, may reconsider
//! promoting agreeing `Corroborated` evidence (for example, a filename and a
//! folder hint that agree with each other); that is deliberately not decided
//! here.
//!
//! # Never a rename authority
//!
//! Nothing in this module may be imported by
//! [`crate::dat::rename_plan`] or [`crate::dat::rename_apply`]. DAT
//! machine/platform identity is corroborating, display-level evidence; the
//! only thing that may authorize a rename is cryptographic hash evidence from
//! [`crate::dat::audit`].
