//! Read-only, format-agnostic DAT storage-completeness classification (Stage 2c).
//!
//! A **catalogue set** is one DAT `<game>` entry; its members are the entry's
//! `<rom>` children. This module answers, for one already-audited archive,
//! which catalogue sets its members touch and whether each is complete —
//! using nothing but evidence [`crate::dat::sources::audit_run::run_dat_audit`]
//! already produced. It never hashes anything, never opens an archive, never
//! calls into [`crate::dat::archive`] or a ZIP/7z reader. A `Complete`
//! resolution may be consumed by [`crate::dat::rename_plan`] only for the
//! narrow, fail-closed purpose of naming the outer archive after an additional
//! one-to-one whole-archive attribution check. Archive-member paths and names
//! never become member-level rename proposals.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Implements the "minimum safe completeness rules" from
//! `docs/research/SET_COMPLETENESS_MILESTONE_RESEARCH.md` §2:
//!
//! - **R1 — membership comes only from the DAT.** A set is emitted only when
//!   at least one of its `<rom>`s was matched by a member's verdict. Nothing
//!   is grouped by filename, basename, or directory.
//! - **R2 — only positionally attributable cryptographic matches count.** A
//!   single candidate counts. Multiple candidates remain ambiguous across
//!   games; within one game, one strong digest may satisfy multiple declared
//!   slots carrying that identical digest. CRC32-only, filename-only, and
//!   unmatched members never count.
//! - **R3 — `nodump` blocks `Complete` unconditionally.** A `<rom
//!   status="nodump">` in the set's DAT entry makes the set
//!   [`SetState::BadMetadata`] the moment the entry is read, whether or not
//!   any member was ever seen for it — a nodump rom is unverifiable by
//!   definition, never "missing".
//! - **R4 — any `baddump` blocks `Complete`, matched or not.** A `baddump`
//!   rom is excluded from the required-member list (its absence is never
//!   read as "incomplete" on its own), but its mere presence in the DAT
//!   entry - whether or not this archive happens to contain a member for it
//!   - makes the set [`SetState::BadMetadata`].
//! - **R5 — classification and unsupported shapes fail closed.** ROMs and
//!   disks are classified by [`MemberClass`]. Contradictory flags, unknown
//!   loadflags, malformed member metadata, duplicate top-level ROM names,
//!   duplicate names used through legacy name-only evidence, and
//!   parser-reported unrepresented structure all refuse a confident verdict.
//!   Software-list part/dataarea/diskarea ownership is traversed without
//!   flattening.
//! - **R9 — a required disk needs CHD header identity, positionally
//!   attributed.** A `MemberClass::PhysicalRequired` disk counts as
//!   storage-present only when this run's CHD evidence
//!   ([`crate::dat::disk_audit`]) reports [`DiskAuditVerdict::Exact`] for the
//!   *exact* [`DatDiskKey`] that disk declares, re-validated against the
//!   current DAT (never trusted from index-build time alone). Ambiguous
//!   (`ExactMultipleCandidates`), malformed-header, not-in-DAT, or duplicate
//!   CHD evidence never counts - mirrors R2's ROM rule. A CHD's own
//!   `parent_required()` fact is surfaced (`disks_parent_required`) but never
//!   blocks or is required for this slot's storage completeness -
//!   parent-chain resolution is Stage 2d's job. Disk evidence in this batch
//!   only *verifies slots for sets already touched by ROM evidence*; a game
//!   declaring disks and no ROMs at all is not yet reachable through this
//!   entry point (see the module's "What this batch does not attempt"). An
//!   incomplete disk scan (`disk_scan_complete = false`) blocks `Complete`
//!   only for a set that actually declares a required disk - it never
//!   downgrades an unrelated ROM-only set just because some other directory
//!   in the same scan had a traversal error.
//! - **ClrMamePro is fail-closed unconditionally.** That parser does not
//!   currently detect *any* of the structure above - no disk/sample/part/
//!   dataarea/device detection at all - so it cannot honestly claim `false`
//!   for `unsupported_structure` on any entry. Every ClrMamePro-sourced game
//!   sets it `true` at parse time, and therefore every set built from it is
//!   [`NeedsReviewReason::UnsupportedSetStructure`] until that parser can
//!   prove complete set-structure observation, never `Complete`.
//! - **A duplicate `game_name` is never resolved by first match.** If the
//!   touched name is not unique in `games`, every candidate is left
//!   [`NeedsReviewReason::DuplicateGameName`] - picking the first match would
//!   silently bind completeness to array order, which is exactly the
//!   positional-identity risk [`SetIdentity`] exists to avoid.
//! - **Duplicate archive evidence is never trusted.** If the same
//!   archive-member index appears more than once in one archive's evidence,
//!   every set that member's verdict(s) touch is
//!   [`NeedsReviewReason::DuplicateArchiveEvidence`] - not reachable from the
//!   current ZIP/7z producers (each enumerates members once, by
//!   construction), but this module does not trust that invariant blindly.
//! - **R7 — per-archive only.** This module takes one archive's evidence at
//!   a time and never aggregates across archives; a set split across two
//!   archives is judged independently in each. Multi-disc/game-scope
//!   aggregation is explicitly out of this storage-scoped stage.
//! - **R8 — a partial pass forbids `Complete` for every set it touches.** Any
//!   [`ArchivePassCompletion`] other than `Complete` — cancelled, budget-cut,
//!   a refused member, or the outer file changing mid-pass — means some
//!   member's true status is unknown, so nothing that pass touched can be
//!   safely called `Complete`, even a set whose own required members all
//!   happen to already be present.
//!
//! # Runtime DAT binding (no reparse gap)
//!
//! [`classify_archive_sets`] is `pub(crate)`, not `pub`: its `games`
//! parameter must be the exact [`crate::dat::model::ParsedDat`] instance
//! [`crate::dat::sources::audit_run::run_dat_audit`] already parsed to build
//! the [`crate::dat::index::DatIndex`] that produced the archive's verdicts,
//! never a slice obtained by independently re-parsing "the same" DAT file.
//! Reparsing separately would open a real gap: the file on disk could change
//! between the two parses, and a set's completeness would then be judged
//! against a different catalogue than the one its verdicts were actually
//! matched against. Restricting visibility to this crate, with
//! `run_dat_audit` as the only caller, makes that gap structurally
//! unreachable rather than merely documented against.
//!
//! # R4 resolves a real inconsistency in the milestone research
//!
//! The milestone research's own prose and pseudocode disagree with each
//! other about `baddump`: R4's prose says a matched baddump makes the set
//! "Needs review", but its §4 state machine says `BadMetadata(baddump)`.
//! An earlier revision of this module additionally let an *unmatched*
//! baddump rom pass silently through to `Complete`, on the reasoning that
//! R4's own `members_required` note excludes baddump roms from the
//! required list. A hostile review flagged that as a real false-positive
//! risk: an archive could be reported `Complete` while the DAT itself
//! quietly knows about a bad dump nobody surfaced anywhere. This module
//! now resolves all of it toward the strictly safer reading stated in R4
//! above: any DAT-listed baddump, matched or not, blocks `Complete`.
//!
//! # What Stage 2c deliberately does not attempt
//!
//! - Any change to [`crate::dat::archive`], ZIP/7z sources, or the archive
//!   evidence shape.
//! - MAME set verification (gated on the parser work R5 refuses around).
//! - Any member-level or inner-archive rename. The only rename consumer is the
//!   separately gated outer-archive proposal described above.
//! - Clone/parent merge-mode semantics, BIOS dependency tracking, multi-disc
//!   or game-scope aggregation, and CHD-reconstruction completeness.
//! - Opening the CHD map, decompressing a hunk, or verifying `raw_sha1`
//!   against reconstructed content - CHD evidence here is header identity
//!   only ([`crate::dat::disk_audit`]).
//! - Resolving a CHD's declared parent: `parent_required()` is surfaced on
//!   [`SetResolution::disks_parent_required`], never located, opened, or
//!   verified.
//! - Classifying a set touched only by disk evidence with zero ROM
//!   declarations. This batch's `classify_archive_sets` still seeds set
//!   membership from ROM verdicts only (R1); CHD evidence verifies disk
//!   slots for sets a ROM verdict already touched. A disk-only game (no
//!   `<rom>` children at all) is simply never emitted by this function
//!   today, the same silent-absence behaviour an untouched ROM-only game
//!   already has, not a false verdict. Extending set membership to be
//!   disk-evidence-driven too is left to a follow-up batch.
