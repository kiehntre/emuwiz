//! Repair transaction execution, reusing the existing `rename_apply` engine.
//!
//! The Repair Center deliberately does **not** invent a parallel transaction
//! system. A repair batch becomes a
//! [`crate::dat::rename_apply::RenameTransaction`], the exact journaled,
//! no-clobber, identity-revalidated model the hardened rename layer already
//! ships, and is applied and rolled back through that engine. The only
//! additions here are:
//!
//! 1. the mapping from a validated [`RepairPlan`] to that transaction
//!    ([`build_repair_transaction`]),
//! 2. the executor driver that enforces "no action may start if the plan is
//!    invalid" ([`apply_repair_transaction`]),
//! 3. a post-apply re-verification pass ([`reverify_transaction`]) and
//! 4. a recovery classification over the existing journal directory
//!    ([`classify_persisted_transactions`]).
//!
//! # The safety boundary is inherited, not re-implemented
//!
//! Every mutation goes through `renameat2(RENAME_NOREPLACE)`, every source is
//! re-verified against its recorded `ObjectIdentity` immediately before the
//! rename and confirmed at the destination after it, the batch is journaled
//! durably before the first mutation, and a failure rolls back completed steps
//! in reverse order with partial-rollback honesty - all from `rename_apply`.
