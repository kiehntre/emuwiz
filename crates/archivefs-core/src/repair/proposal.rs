//! The typed Repair Center proposal vocabulary.
//!
//! A [`RepairProposal`] is a *claim*: it names a source object, an action
//! (a rename or a same-filesystem move), why that action is proposed, and the
//! evidence the claim rests on. A proposal is **never permission to mutate** -
//! every action is revalidated by [`crate::repair::preflight`] and again by the
//! transaction executor immediately before execution.
//!
//! # Deliberately small
//!
//! Only `RenamePath` and `MovePath` are executable. Every future action kind
//! (`DeleteDuplicate`, `RebuildArchive`, `RewriteArchiveMember`, `ConvertDisc`,
//! `FetchMissing`) exists only as a typed, non-executable [`RepairAction::Deferred`]
//! variant so a future planner can name its intent without ever acquiring a
//! mutation path through this layer.
//!
//! # Identity is typed, never a display string
//!
//! `expected_source_identity` is the strongest existing filesystem identity
//! model (`crate::dat::rename_apply::ObjectIdentity`: size, kind, inode and
//! device where available, captured without following symlinks). It is carried
//! so preflight and execution can refuse an action whose source changed after
//! the proposal was created. DAT provenance is carried as typed optional
//! fields, not a single opaque string.
