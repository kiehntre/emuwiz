//! Duplicate-content quarantine: moving only the redundant copy of a proven
//! duplicate-content group into a trusted-root-local quarantine directory,
//! using ordinary [`RepairAction::MovePath`] semantics.
//!
//! This is the first *mutating* slice built on top of the read-only
//! [`super::duplicate`] proof: it still never deletes anything.
//! `DeferredActionKind::DeleteDuplicate` remains permanently non-executable
//! (`RepairAction::is_executable` is `true` only for `RenamePath`/`MovePath`)
//! and this module never constructs one. A quarantine move is fully
//! reversible through the existing journal/rollback machinery.
//!
//! # The pipeline
//!
//! 1. [`select_survivor`] - a pure, objective decision from
//!    [`KeeperEvidence`] only (already-canonical DAT name, or a confidently
//!    verified DAT match). Never size, mtime, lexical path, root order, or
//!    platform. No unique winner -> [`SurvivorSelection::NeedsReview`], and
//!    no Safe move is ever produced for that group.
//! 2. [`plan_duplicate_quarantine`] - proves every other member against the
//!    chosen survivor via [`super::duplicate::prove_duplicate_content`] and
//!    builds one `Safe` `MovePath` [`RepairProposal`] per member proven a
//!    **distinct-object** duplicate. A `SameObject` (hard-linked) member, or
//!    one whose proof refuses, is recorded in
//!    [`QuarantineGroupPlan::skipped`] with why - never silently dropped,
//!    and never blocking the group's other members.
//! 3. [`build_quarantine_transaction`] - re-proves every proposal live
//!    (stored `RepairEvidence`/identity is never mutation authority) and
//!    builds a [`RenameTransaction`]. Deliberately **not**
//!    [`crate::repair::execute::build_repair_transaction`]: that function's
//!    validation requires the `MovePath` destination directory to already
//!    exist, which is never true for a fresh quarantine bucket - directory
//!    creation (and ownership) happens only at apply time, exactly like
//!    [`crate::dat::rom_organisation::transaction`].
//! 4. [`apply_quarantine_transaction`] - re-proves the whole batch live
//!    *again* before any mutation or directory creation, then creates the
//!    quarantine directories this transaction needs (ownership recorded
//!    strictly after `create_dir` succeeds; a pre-existing symlink there is
//!    refused, never followed), then applies entries one at a time -
//!    re-proving **each entry individually against the survivor
//!    immediately before that entry's own move**, so a later entry in a
//!    multi-member group never moves on the strength of the earlier
//!    whole-batch proof alone. Any failure aborts the remaining entries
//!    (`AbortAll` semantics), leaving already-applied entries applied and
//!    the rest untouched.
//! 5. [`rollback_quarantine_transaction`] - the shared rollback engine for
//!    the moves, then removes only the quarantine directories this
//!    transaction created, only while still empty, never a pre-existing one.
//!
//! # Not sole mutation authority either
//!
//! Exactly like [`super::duplicate::DuplicateContentProof`], nothing built
//! here is ever trusted from a stored copy: [`build_quarantine_transaction`]
//! and [`apply_quarantine_transaction`] each independently re-prove against
//! the live filesystem before doing anything with the result.

///
/// 1. **Whole-batch pre-proof**, before a single directory is created or a
///    single file moved: every entry's source is re-proven a distinct-object
///    duplicate of `survivor_path`. Any disagreement here aborts the entire
///    batch immediately, before any mutation - this is the cheap, obvious
///    check.
/// 2. **Per-entry pre-move re-proof**, immediately before *each* individual
///    move, interleaved with the apply loop below: a later entry never moves
///    on the strength of the batch-wide proof above alone. This closes the
///    multi-entry TOCTOU a whole-batch-only proof leaves open - the survivor
///    could still be replaced, renamed, or turned into a hard link *between*
///    two entries' moves in the same batch, after the first check already
///    passed and after an earlier entry already moved.
///
/// Deliberately not [`apply_transaction`] for the mutation loop: the shared
/// executor applies a whole batch in one call with no hook between entries,
/// and adding a domain-specific "re-prove against an external survivor path"
/// hook there would broaden its generic rename semantics for one caller.
/// Instead this function runs its own per-entry loop, reusing the exact same
/// primitives the shared executor uses internally
/// (`run_preflight`, `apply_mutation`, `write_journal`) - never a second
/// implementation of preflight or the mutation itself, only different
/// control flow around them.
///
/// # Directory ownership
///
/// Only after every entry passes the whole-batch pre-proof are the
/// quarantine directories this transaction needs created, one at a time. A
/// pre-existing **symlink** at a quarantine directory's path is refused
/// outright, never followed or treated as pre-existing-and-usable - a
/// quarantine directory must always be a real directory EmuWiz can prove it
/// owns or safely ignores. A directory is appended to
/// `transaction.created_directories` **only after `create_dir` succeeds**,
/// and the journal is rewritten durably immediately afterwards - the same
