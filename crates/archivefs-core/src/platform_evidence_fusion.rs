//! The first conservative, explainable content-evidence fusion layer.
//!
//! ```text
//! DETECTOR OBSERVES
//!     -> crate::content_evidence::ContentEvidence (already exists)
//!     -> FUSION groups/weighs/compares (this module)
//!     -> ResolutionExplanation / FusionOutcome
//!     -> a later, separately reviewed layer may act
//! ```
//!
//! This module never renames, moves, deletes, or authorizes any action. It
//! turns a bag of [`ContentEvidence`] facts (already produced by this
//! crate's existing `*_boot_evidence`/`*_header_evidence`/digital-package
//! modules - nothing here parses bytes itself) into one of four outcomes -
//! see [`FusionOutcome`] - plus a structured explanation of exactly why.
//!
//! # Why this is not [`crate::platform::identity`]
//!
//! [`crate::platform::identity::resolve_platform_identity`] already fuses
//! evidence, but at a different, downstream layer: its inputs
//! ([`crate::platform::identity::PlatformIdentityEvidence`]) are
//! *already-decided platform strings* from external providers (a RomM
//! match, a verified DAT audit, a manual assignment) - the "was this file
//! ever a Saturn ROM" question has already been answered by the time that
//! resolver sees anything. This module answers that question in the first
//! place, from raw structural facts (`"SEGA SEGASATURN"`, `"XDVDFS"`,
//! `"XBEH"`, ...) that never carry a platform label on their own - see
//! [`crate::content_evidence`]'s own module documentation for why. A
//! [`Resolved`](FusionOutcome::Resolved) [`ResolutionExplanation`] from this
//! module is exactly the kind of fact a caller could offer to
//! `PlatformIdentityEvidence` at `PlatformIdentitySource::Inference` -
//! bridging the two layers explicitly, rather than merging their separate
//! confidence vocabularies into one.
//!
//! # Rule-based, not score-based
//!
//! [`RULES`] is a fixed table of explicit, reviewed combinations - "XDVDFS +
//! XBEH => Xbox," never "Xbox = 37 points." See [`FusionRule`] and the
//! module-level rule catalog for every combination this milestone reviewed,
//! and the module documentation's own worked examples for why: opaque
//! numeric scoring hides exactly the reasoning this milestone exists to
//! surface.
//!
//! # The confidence/scope split
//!
//! [`crate::content_evidence::ContentEvidenceConfidence`] says how reliably
//! a fact was observed; [`crate::content_evidence_scope::EvidenceScope`]
//! (a separate module) says whether that fact could ever discriminate a
//! platform at all. A rule's legs are expressed in terms of confidence
//! (`RequiredFact::min_confidence`) because that is what a real detector
//! actually reports; [`content_evidence_scope`]'s own test suite
//! cross-checks that every fact this module's rules treat as
//! platform-discriminating is not accidentally
//! [`crate::content_evidence_scope::EvidenceScope::Generic`] - see
//! `tests::every_exact_rule_leg_is_at_least_family_scoped`.
