//! Read-only registry of all known cheat sources.
//!
//! The registry is a flat list of `CheatSourceEntry` values that describe
//! every built-in provider and (in future stages) every user-configured
//! custom source. It wraps and describes providers; it does not mutate them.
//!
//! ## Provider counting
//!
//! Ten registry entries covering seven distinct upstream projects and nine
//! logical data sources:
//!
//! - libretro-buildbot-cheats (libretro/libretro-database)
//! - pcsx2-official-patches-tree (PCSX2/pcsx2_patches)
//! - gamehacking.org split into three platform-specific registry entries
//!   (PS2, GameCube, Wii) because the upstream treats them as separate
//!   platforms with different matching, caching, and scraping paths
//! - dolphin_upstream_gamesettings + dolphin_upstream_catalogue
//!   (two distinct Dolphin sources sharing the same upstream repository)
//! - xenia_canary_game_patches (xenia-canary/game-patches)
//! - bsfree-archive (Andrew Mackrodt's BSFree Archive)
//! - cheatbase (CheatBase's pinned, browse-only SQLite catalogue)
//!
//! The three figures differ for different reasons. `upstream_project` names a
//! repository, and gamehacking.org accounts for three entries while
//! dolphin-emu/dolphin accounts for two, so ten entries name seven
//! repositories between them - that is the number
//! `the_registry_covers_seven_distinct_upstream_projects` derives from the entries
//! and pins. "Logical data sources" counts the distinct bodies of data rather
//! than the repositories or the entries; it is an editorial figure with no field
//! behind it, so nothing asserts it.
