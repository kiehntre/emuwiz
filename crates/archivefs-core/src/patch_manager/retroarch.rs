//! Read-only RetroArch cheat/patch destination preview.
//!
//! This is the second concrete emulator preview built on top of
//! `patch_manager`, after PCSX2's `preview_pcsx2_metadata`. It deliberately
//! does **not** implement [`super::EmulatorAdapter`] and does **not**
//! produce an [`super::AdvisoryPatchPlan`]: that trait and type are shaped
//! around PCSX2's specific model (`"PS2"` platform filtering baked into
//! `patch_manager::mod`, exactly one `data_root` per installation
//! candidate, exactly one hypothetical relative path per metadata record)
//! and none of that fits RetroArch, which has no single patch/cheat root,
//! several purpose-tagged directories per installation, and a
//! core-selection ambiguity axis PCSX2 has no analogue for at all (see
//! `docs/PATCH_CHEAT_MANAGER_DESIGN.md`'s "Known RetroArch gaps" list).
//! Forcing RetroArch through that trait would either weaken it for PCSX2
//! or silently misrepresent RetroArch; this module is the "separate,
//! narrowly-scoped advisory type" the design review anticipated instead.
//!
//! **No network call of any kind is made here.** Unlike PCSX2 - which has
//! one reviewed, compiled-in upstream metadata endpoint
//! (`patch_manager::BUILT_IN_SOURCE_URL`) - no RetroArch metadata source
//! (upstream cheat database, licensing, or source policy) has been
//! reviewed or approved. `HttpsMetadataFetcher::fetch` continues to accept
//! only that one PCSX2 URL and is not used, imported, or extended by this
//! module. Consequently there is no external "record" to match a
//! catalogue game against the way PCSX2 matches a `.pnach` filename's
//! serial/CRC to a catalogue row: **the catalogue game itself is the only
//! input**, and every entry below is produced only from data already on
//! local disk (the RetroArch installation environment already discovered
//! by `emulator_environment::retroarch`, and the read-only EmuWiz
//! catalogue). See `docs/RETROARCH_PATCH_PREVIEW.md` for the full design
//! record, including the primary RetroArch source citations the cheat/
//! patch destination conventions below are based on.
//!
//! Because there is no external record, there is also no PCSX2-style
//! "game identity" matching problem here (a catalogue row is never
//! ambiguous with *itself*). The one genuine ambiguity axis RetroArch has
//! that PCSX2 does not is **core selection**: RetroArch's own per-game
//! cheat file path is scoped by which core loaded the content
//! (`cheat_manager_get_game_specific_filename`'s `core_name` component),
//! and EmuWiz has no reliable way to know which installed core a user
//! would actually pick. This module resolves that only when it is
//! genuinely unambiguous - exactly one installed core's own `.info`
//! metadata (already inventoried by `emulator_environment::retroarch`,
//! not re-derived here) declares the catalogue archive's file extension as
//! supported - and reports `AmbiguousCore`/`UnsupportedNoCore` rather than
//! guessing otherwise.
//!
//! `serial`/`executable_crc`-based exact identity (PCSX2's strongest tier)
//! is deliberately **not** modeled here at all, even opportunistically:
//! unlike PCSX2 (which at least has an upstream record to compare those
//! fields against, even though the catalogue side is unpopulated in
//! production today), RetroArch has no second record to compare a
//! catalogue row's identity fields against in this milestone, so a
//! same-row "exact match" would be vacuous. `no_identity_tier_is_used_for_retroarch_matching`
//! in the test module below locks in that this stays true even if a
//! catalogue row is ever populated with those fields.
