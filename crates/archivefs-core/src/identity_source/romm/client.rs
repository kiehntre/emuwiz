//! A small read-only RomM client.
//!
//! Hand-written on purpose. Generating a client from RomM's OpenAPI document
//! would produce something around 170 endpoints wide, most of which write, and
//! every one of those would be a path this milestone promises does not exist. A
//! reviewed client with four read requests in it is the safer artefact: what it
//! can do is what you can see.
//!
//! # The four requests
//!
//! | Purpose | Request |
//! |---------|---------|
//! | connection test | `GET /api/heartbeat` (no token needed) |
//! | capability check | `GET /openapi.json` |
//! | platforms | `GET /api/platforms` |
//! | one page of ROMs | `GET /api/roms?limit=&offset=` |
//!
//! There is no `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` or `DELETE` anywhere in this module, and a
//! test asserts that by reading the source.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! Every request has a connect and read timeout, a response-size ceiling
//! enforced while reading rather than after, and a cancellation check between
//! steps. Redirects are disabled at the agent, and a redirect status is turned
//! into an explained refusal by the endpoint policy rather than followed.
