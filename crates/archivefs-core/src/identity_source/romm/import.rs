//! Driving one import, and the status it produces.
//!
//! # Bounds, and why each exists
//!
//! Every limit here answers a specific way a remote server can misbehave:
//!
//! - page size is clamped, so a configured page cannot be unbounded;
//! - the page count is capped, so a server that never reports the end cannot
//!   loop for ever;
//! - the record count is capped, so a server with a runaway catalogue cannot
//!   produce an unbounded cache;
//! - a page whose offset does not advance ends the walk, because a server
//!   returning the same page for ever is the other way to loop;
//! - the *server's* total is treated as a hint for progress only. The walk ends
//!   when a page comes back short or empty, not when the total says so, because
//!   a wrong total should not truncate an import or extend it indefinitely;
//! - an overall deadline stops an import that is technically progressing but
//!   will not finish today.
//!
//! # Oversized pages
//!
//! A page of records can exceed the client's response ceiling: a real RomM 5.1.0
//! catalogue did so at offset 4400 with 100 records per page. The ceiling is not
//! raised in response - it is what stops a hostile or broken server handing over
//! an unbounded body. Instead the *same offset* is retried with a smaller page,
//! stepping down a fixed ladder, and the import continues at whatever size
//! worked. Because the offset does not move until a page succeeds, no record is
//! skipped and none is fetched twice. See [`next_page_size`].
//!
//! Two things happen after the ladder runs out, because a real catalogue needed
//! both:
//!
//! - **A single record can be too large on its own.** One PS4 game carried 28,831
//!   entries in its file list, making its own response 17.5 MB. That record is
//!   re-fetched *without* the per-file detail, which brings it to 436 KB. The file
//!   list is what is lost, and every record it happens to is counted and named in
//!   [`AdaptivePagination`] rather than quietly emptied.
//! - **The size recovers, carefully.** A reduction is caused by particular fat
//!   records, not by a property of the server: pages either side of that one were
//!   1.5 MB. Staying at the reduced size for the rest of a 36,259-record catalogue
//!   would need tens of thousands of requests and could not finish inside the
//!   deadline, so after [`RECOVERY_STREAK`] consecutive successes the size steps
//!   back up one rung, never above what was configured. The gate and a global
//!   budget of [`MAX_OVERSIZED_EVENTS`] refusals are what stop that from becoming
//!   an oscillation: past the budget the size freezes and never climbs again.
//!
//! # Nothing is published until everything succeeds
//!
//! Records accumulate in memory, are matched, are validated as a whole, and only
//! then written. Any failure - transport, malformed page, cancellation, a
//! validation refusal - returns an error and the previous cache stays exactly
//! where it was. See [`crate::identity_source::cache::publish_cache`].
