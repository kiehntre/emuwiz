//! The local-only endpoint policy for external identity sources.
//!
//! An identity source is a URL a person types in, and EmuWiz then connects to
//! it with a bearer token attached. That combination is exactly the shape of a
//! server-side request forgery, so this module exists to make the dangerous
//! cases unreachable rather than unlikely.
//!
//! # What is allowed
//!
//! Only `http` or `https`, only to an address that resolves inside one of the
//! ranges a home or container network actually uses:
//!
//! - `127.0.0.0/8` and `::1` - loopback
//! - `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16` - RFC 1918
//! - `fc00::/7` - IPv6 unique local, the equivalent for container networks
//!
//! Everything else is refused, including every public address.
//!
//! # Why resolution happens here
//!
//! A hostname is not an address. `romm.example.com` may resolve to a private
//! address today and a public one tomorrow, and a name that resolves to several
//! addresses may offer a private one first and a public one second. So the
//! policy resolves the host itself and requires **every** returned address to be
//! approved - not merely the one that happens to be tried first. A name that
//! resolves to any public address is refused outright, which is what closes the
//! DNS-rebinding hole.
//!
//! # Redirects
//!
//! Not followed. The client is configured with zero redirects, and a redirect
//! response is reported as a refusal naming the destination. Following one would
//! mean re-running this whole policy against an address the user never entered,
//! and Stage 1 has no need for it. [`validate_redirect_target`] exists so that a
//! later stage which does want a small bounded number of redirects has one
//! obvious place to revalidate, and so the tests can prove a public redirect is
//! refused today.
//!
//! # Cloud metadata
//!
//! `169.254.169.254` and its friends are link-local, so the range rules already
//! refuse them. They are also named explicitly, because "the metadata endpoint
//! is refused" is a property worth asserting directly rather than inferring.
