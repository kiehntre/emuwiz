//! A bounded, provider-owned thumbnail cache.
//!
//! RomM stays the owner of cover art. EmuWiz caches only what a card needs to
//! draw: a thumbnail fitting inside [`THUMBNAIL_MAX_WIDTH`] x
//! [`THUMBNAIL_MAX_HEIGHT`], fetched lazily when artwork becomes visible, never in
//! bulk during a catalogue import.
//!
//! # Only RomM's own artwork is fetchable
//!
//! This is the part worth reading twice. A RomM record carries two artwork
//! references, and they are not equivalent:
//!
//! - `url_cover` points at whatever scraper supplied the metadata. On a real
//!   instance those were `https://images.igdb.com/...` and
//!   `https://retroachievements.org/...` - public hosts on the open internet.
//! - `path_cover_small` is a path on the RomM instance itself, e.g.
//!   `/assets/romm/resources/roms/149/1/cover/small.png?ts=...`.
//!
//! Only the second is ever fetched. Fetching the first would drive outbound
//! requests to arbitrary public hosts from a subsystem whose entire premise is
//! that it talks to one approved private address - so `url_cover` is recorded for
//! provenance and refused as a fetch target, by
//! [`ArtworkRefusal::RemoteHostNotAllowed`].
//!
//! A reference is resolved against the approved origin and then the *result* is
//! checked to still be that origin. Resolving first and checking after is what
//! makes `//evil.example/x` and `http://evil.example/x` refusals rather than
//! requests: both are legal relative-URL forms that change the host.
//!
//! # Bounded at every step
//!
//! Response bytes, source dimensions, decode allocation, thumbnail dimensions and
//! total cache size all have ceilings. A cover is ~55 KB and 162x216 on the
//! instance this was written against; the limits are set well above that and far
//! below anything that could exhaust memory.
//!
//! # Nothing secret is stored
//!
//! Cache keys are derived from the server identity, the record id and RomM's own
//! artwork timestamp. No token is used in a key, a filename, or the index; the
//! index holds the approved origin, record ids and digests, and no cover path or
//! URL at all. Artwork on the tested instance needs no authentication, so the token
//! is only offered if a request is actually refused without it.

// their own version over the file lose one of the two entries - the rename is
// atomic, so the file is never torn, but the *update* is not, so the second writer
// silently reverts the first.
//
// The fix is to make every modification re-read the index while holding a lock and
// merge into whatever is there now. Reads stay unlocked: a rename is atomic, so a
// reader sees either the whole previous index or the whole next one, never a mix.

/// How long a caller waits for another process to finish its index update.
