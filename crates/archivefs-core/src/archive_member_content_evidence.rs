//! Bounded, read-only ZIP archive-member **content** evidence: runs this
//! crate's existing [`crate::content_detector::ContentDetector`]s against a
//! bounded prefix of each member's *decompressed* bytes, then aggregates the
//! results with an explicit, never-silently-resolved multi-member policy.
//!
//! # How this differs from the two existing archive modules
//!
//! - [`crate::inspector`] lists ZIP entries' **metadata only** (name, size,
//!   compression method) - it deliberately never reads an entry's data, and
//!   its `classify_entry` is a filename-extension guess, never a content
//!   observation. This module reuses [`crate::inspector::classify_entry`]
//!   for its own bounded pre-filter (skip directories, documentation, and
//!   artwork before ever decompressing anything) but goes one step further
//!   for the remaining candidates: it actually decompresses a bounded
//!   prefix and runs real detectors over it.
//! - [`crate::dat::archive::zip`]/[`crate::dat::archive::sevenz`] hash every
//!   member's **entire** decompressed stream, for DAT-verification purposes
//!   - the opposite performance profile from what content *identification*
//!     needs. This module never fully decompresses a member; see
//!   [`MAX_MEMBER_PROBE_BYTES`].
//!
//! # Filename is never authority
//!
//! Nothing in this module infers content type from a member's name or
//! extension beyond the same coarse, already-reviewed
//! [`crate::inspector::classify_entry`] pre-filter every other archive
//! consumer in this crate already uses to decide what is even worth
//! decompressing - that filter only ever *skips* candidates early (documentation,
//! artwork, nested archives, directories); it never *selects* a winner. The
//! actual evidence for every candidate member comes from
//! [`crate::content_detector::run_content_detectors`] over its real,
//! decompressed bytes.
//!
//! # Multi-member policy - never a silent "largest member wins"
//!
//! [`classify_archive_content`] never picks a member. A ZIP with
//! `game1.rom` and `game2.rom` producing two different, confident product
//! identities is reported as [`ArchiveContentClassification::ConflictingStrongMembers`],
//! not resolved to one. See that function's own documentation for every
//! outcome.
//!
//! # Safety bounds
//!
//! - [`MAX_MEMBERS_PROBED`]: at most this many stream-bearing candidate
//!   members are ever decompressed in one archive pass.
//! - [`MAX_MEMBER_PROBE_BYTES`]: at most this many decompressed bytes are
//!   ever read per member - covers every fixed-offset cartridge header this
//!   crate knows (through SNES HiROM's `0xFFC0` candidate), never a whole
//!   member.
//! - A member whose *declared* (pre-decompression) uncompressed size exceeds
//!   [`MAX_CANDIDATE_MEMBER_SIZE`] is skipped without ever being opened -
//!   this bounds against an archive-bomb-style member whose compressed size
//!   is tiny but declared uncompressed size is enormous (the same declared-
//!   size check [`crate::inspector`] already surfaces, applied here as a
//!   gate rather than just a displayed number).
//! - No extraction to disk, no path traversal (member names are never used
//!   to touch the filesystem), and no nested-archive recursion - a member
//!   [`crate::inspector::classify_entry`] classifies as
//!   [`crate::inspector::InspectorEntryClassification::NestedArchive`] is
//!   surfaced with metadata only, exactly like [`crate::inspector`] already
//!   treats it.
