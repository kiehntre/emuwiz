# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to EmuWiz are recorded here. The format is
loosely inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), but this
project does not yet claim strict compliance with that format, and versions
prior to 1.0 do not follow semantic versioning guarantees.

Entries below `Unreleased` and each tagged version are reconstructed from git
tags, commit history, and `Cargo.toml` version bumps. Where a commit's exact
user-facing effect could not be confirmed from its message and diff alone,
this file describes only what the code and history actually show, rather than
guessing at intent, dates, or scope.

## v0.8.1-alpha (unreleased)

Identity, launch, optical, and whole-collection library release
("Alpha 2.1"). **Not yet tagged or published.** The currently published
release remains [`v0.8.0-alpha`](docs/releases/v0.8.0-alpha.md); this entry
describes what has merged to the current candidate branch toward the next
alpha so far. See
[`docs/releases/v0.8.1-alpha.md`](docs/releases/v0.8.1-alpha.md) for full
release notes.

### Added

- **Dolphin texture-mod inspection and apply workflow.** Selected PNG
  textures and validated manifest-backed texture packs can be previewed and
  applied through the GUI's verified transaction path, with backups and
  rollback. General mod formats remain outside this supported slice.

- **Verified disc and folder identity for more platforms.** ScummVM game
  folders, 3DO game discs, and PC-FX game discs are now identified from
  their own on-disc/structural evidence (Opera volume header, PC-FX boot
  sectors, ScummVM detection entries), never from a filename. Loose-ROM
  identity for NES, Game Boy / Game Boy Color / Game Boy Advance, and N64
  is verified from cartridge headers, and PlayStation, Saturn, Dreamcast,
  PSP, PS3, and original Xbox disc identity is promoted into the game
  reports.
- **Canonical optical fingerprinting.** A representation-independent
  fingerprint of an optical disc's actual data content, so the same disc
  in CUE/BIN and in CHD form compares as equivalent, and a
  chdman MODE1 conversion can be checked against its source.
- **Verified CUE/BIN -> CHD conversion.** A deliberately narrow conversion
  path that only finalizes when the staged CHD independently reproduces the
  source's canonical optical fingerprint, run through the existing
  journalled transaction engine with rollback and crash recovery, plus a
  GUI workflow ("Convert discs" on Home) to preview, apply, and undo it.
- **CUE/BIN <-> CHD and equivalent-representation review.** Review tools
  for byte-different but content-equivalent optical discs and for
  equivalent N64 ROM representations, alongside the existing exact-duplicate
  quarantine.
- **Whole-collection RomM-ready library planning.** Point EmuWiz at several
  platform libraries at once and get one combined, deterministic RomM
  layout plan across the whole collection, reusing the existing Playing
  Library / 1G1R election and single-platform RomM projection unchanged.
  The combined plan adds read-only preview checks the single-platform path
  cannot perform - missing source, unsafe (symlinked) source, an occupied
  destination, and a destination two platform inputs both claim - each
  reported, never auto-resolved. Apply reuses the existing journalled,
  no-clobber symlink transaction engine per platform.
- **Verified native launch and readiness for more emulators.** Verified
  native ScummVM launch execution, plus safe command planning and/or
  readiness reporting for PPSSPP, RPCS3, xemu, and Xenia, wired into the
  Doctor and Game Details readiness views.
- **Unified launch and identity architecture.** Launch now separates
  compatibility, verified identity, emulator/profile discovery, readiness,
  command planning, and execution. RetroArch core matching/preferences, MAME
  shortname authority, PCSX2 direct-content restrictions, and the launch
  evidence bridge are family-specific and fail closed when evidence is
  insufficient.
- **Additional identity and DAT evidence.** PS2 CHD identity, NGP/NGPC
  headers, Dreamcast specialist routing, Macintosh DC42 evidence, C64/tape
  ambiguity hardening, and Virtual Boy media recognition are represented
  conservatively. DAT identity, disk-only CHD set audits, set verdicts, and
  verified identity facts persist their provenance and freshness.
- **Cheats & Mods apply safety.** Selected verified PCSX2, Dolphin,
  RetroArch, and GameCube/Wii provider records can use the shared confirmed
  transaction path with journal/history and rollback where supported.
  Safe local mod-package inspection/planning exists, but unsupported formats,
  downloads, external installers, exact resume, CheatBase Stage 1, and a
  universal mod installer are not included.
- **Current documentation and diagnostics.** Architecture, launch support,
  front-door workflows, Doctor findings, and historical/superseded guidance
  now describe the current EmuWiz boundaries.
- **DAT collection completion reporting.** The DAT Sources page shows how
  complete a catalogued collection is against its managed DATs.
- **Managed DAT snapshot provenance and local revision rollback.** Managed
  DAT sources (MAME, Redump, TOSEC, No-Intro browser-assisted import)
  record which snapshot revision each catalogue came from, expose a
  "Revision history" view, and support rolling a source back to a previous
  local revision. Bulk DAT source validation surfaces unusable or
  misconfigured sources in one pass.
- **Home entry points for the major workflows.** The Home screen now has
  direct cards for Build RomM library, Convert discs, Find duplicate /
  equivalent games, Verify collection (DATs), Set up emulators, and
  Cheats & Mods, with clearer DAT collection-completion, revision-history,
  and rollback discoverability on the DAT Sources page.

### Changed

- **Transactional safety audit for the apply/rollback workflows.** The
  landed DAT-rename, Playing Library / RomM symlink, optical-conversion,
  and duplicate-quarantine apply/rollback paths were audited against
  TOCTOU, interrupted-apply, stale-journal, and rollback-refusal cases.
  No production safety regression was found; the existing fail-closed
  behaviour (no-clobber `renameat2`, double preflight, identity
  re-verification, ancestor-path confinement, honest crash reconciliation)
  is unchanged.
- **Cross-platform RomM destination-collision refusal is now proven.**
  Added regression tests showing that two per-platform RomM apply
  transactions that target the same destination path cannot overwrite each
  other or a user's originals - the second is refused by the shared
  engine's live filesystem check, in either hard-conflict mode and
  regardless of apply order.
- A large run of read-only identity, emulator-adapter, evidence-ingestion,
  and launch-planning groundwork merged in this range (explainable platform
  evidence fusion, normalized DAT matching and set identity, local emulator
  adapters and BIOS verification, universal source ingestion, reversible
  ROM header/SMD/N64 normalization observation, and RAR5 audit
  integration).

### Known limitations

- 3DO and PC-FX identity is read from 2048-byte-sector ISO images and from
  MODE1/MODE2 2352 CUE/BIN; 3DO and PC-FX identity from `.chd` is not yet
  supported and fails closed rather than guessing.
- CHD identity overall remains limited: PlayStation (pure-Rust track
  reader) and multi-track Dreamcast GD-ROM (only when the optional
  `chd-optical-specialist` build feature is enabled) are the supported
  cases; other platforms' CHDs are refused.
- Not every emulator or platform has verified native launch support; some
  emulators expose readiness/command-planning only, and unverified inputs
  fail closed rather than launching.
- The whole-collection RomM planner produces the combined plan and the
  per-platform apply transactions, but is driven through the existing
  Playing Library / RomM GUI rather than a dedicated multi-platform wizard.
- Reversible ROM header / SMD / N64 normalization is observation only in
  this release; no ROM is rewritten.

## v0.8.0-alpha (2026-08-18)

Frontend Profiles / RomM Library Views and repair-workflow release
("Alpha 2.0"). See
[`docs/releases/v0.8.0-alpha.md`](docs/releases/v0.8.0-alpha.md) for full
release notes.

### Added

- **Library Views** (Frontend Profiles / RomM): named, symlink-based
  organized folder trees generated from the existing catalogue, in a
  `Generic` (`{platform}/{filename}`) or `Romm` (`roms/{slug}/{filename}`)
  layout, planned (preview) and applied (create/repair/remove) as two
  separate, explicit steps. Always derived - never copies, moves, renames,
  or modifies an original archive.
- A centralized media registry as the single source of truth for which
  file extensions EmuWiz recognises and how each persists, shared by
  scanning, rescanning, and the filesystem watcher (closing a real drift
  where `.gcz`/`.rvz`/`.wbfs`/`.ciso` were scan-recognised but
  watch-blind).
- Loose Commodore `.d64`/`.g64` (C128) and MAME `.chd` (Neo Geo CD, Sega
  CD, arcade, redump CD/DVD sets) recognised as catalogued media, plus a
  `neocdz` folder alias for Neo Geo CD.
- Trusted local DTD diagnostics: a Logiqx DAT's `DOCTYPE` external
  identifier is resolved against a short, explicit, local-only allowlist
  with real provenance diagnostics, replacing the previous blanket
  "accepted as inert text" note. Read-only, local-only, no network
  request, no DTD schema validation claimed.
- A whole-library Repair Center: a transaction-based, journal-checkpointed,
  no-clobber rename executor with crash-safe recovery/reconciliation and
  rollback, a whole-library repair planner (CLI `repair scan`/`plan`/
  `apply`), a Repair Review GUI (preview, select, apply, always re-scanning
  and re-proving the plan before mutating anything), Repair History with
  safe undo, and duplicate-content quarantine/review (byte-identical
  duplicates safely moved to a reversible `.emuwiz-quarantine` folder,
  never permanently deleted; groups with no unique objective survivor are
  left needs-review, never guessed at).
- GUI "Scan library for repairs": runs the same whole-library repair-scan
  engine the CLI already had, on a background thread, and loads a
  successful result directly into Repair Review.
- A drillable, bounded (1000-entry-capped, honestly-reported-when-truncated)
  skipped-file list in the GUI, alongside the existing exact aggregate
  skip counts.

### Changed

- Library View Apply hardened: every Create/Repair/RemoveStale/
  managed-directory-cleanup path now verifies destination containment via
  canonicalization (closing a symlink-escape class of bug), and
  Create/Repair re-verify the source target's existence, type, source-root
  containment, and recorded size/mtime fingerprint immediately before
  mutating anything.
- Rename-transaction restart recovery now reconciles a transaction-level
  status left stuck at `Applying` (a final journal write that failed to
  land after every entry had already durably settled) using the same
  completion rule the executor's own happy path already applies, and fails
  closed whenever that outcome cannot be proven. The GUI's fresh-restart
  load path and its already-open-page recovery refresh now share this
  reconciliation.
- Bounded 7z member DAT verification, CHD v5 header identity and disk
  identity evidence, dependency-aware (Stage 2d) and conservative Stage 1/2
  set-completeness semantics, nested software-list DAT member indexing,
  safe outer-archive renaming, optional fd-pinned RAR5 verification, and a
  No-Intro/SMS DAT semantics fix (verified status and `cloneofid`
  handling) all merged in this range.

### Known limitations

- ES-DE frontend output is not implemented (typed placeholder, fails
  closed rather than falling back to `Generic`).
- RomM Library View identity-cache server-ID validation is deferred (a
  deliberate, documented choice - not an oversight).
- CUE/BIN, GDI, and M3U grouping are not implemented; the media registry
  recognises single files only.
- A `.chd` extension alone is never sufficient platform identity by
  itself.
- No claim of broad Libretro-extension support - the media registry
  covers only the specific formats added in this range.

## v0.7.2-alpha (2026-08-13)

Archive-aware DAT verification release ("Alpha 1.2"). See
[`docs/releases/v0.7.2-alpha.md`](docs/releases/v0.7.2-alpha.md) for concise
release and upgrade notes.

### Added

- Production, read-only DAT verification for individual members of ZIP
  archives, with member evidence kept separate from loose-file evidence and
  excluded from rename proposals.
- Bounded archive preflight and safety controls, including entry and byte
  budgets, decompression-ratio checks, cancellation, CRC completion, and
  outer-file identity revalidation.
- Format-neutral archive-member groundwork and a hardened, read-only 7z
  reader for future integration. 7z DAT verification is not yet a production
  audit path.

### Changed

- DAT index evidence now preserves each ROM entry's `status` and `merge`
  provenance.
- Logiqx DAT sizes accept both decimal and `0x`/`0X`-prefixed hexadecimal
  values, including real-world MAME values such as `size="0x80000"`.
- CI avoids duplicate branch-push runs for pull requests while retaining
  pull-request validation, main-branch push validation, and manual dispatch.

### Known limitations

- ZIP-member verification is read-only. Archive members are not renamed and
  ZIP archives are never rewritten or recompressed.
- The production ZIP path supports Stored and Deflate members; encrypted,
  nested, malformed, and unsupported-codec members fail closed.
- 7z support remains groundwork only. RAR, CHD verification, NES header
  normalization, and set-completeness modelling are not included.

## v0.7.1-alpha (2026-08-13)

Stabilization release ("Alpha 1.1"). This release-prep pass (PR #41) itself
introduces no new implementation - it is a docs, version-bump, and changelog
change only. Alpha 1.1 *as a release*, however, does ship real user-facing
functionality: everything merged to `main` between `v0.7.0`'s tag and this
release-prep work, consolidated here into a single tagged, installable build
alongside a correction of stale documentation. See
[`docs/releases/v0.7.1-alpha.md`](docs/releases/v0.7.1-alpha.md) for
installation, upgrade, and validation guidance.

### Added

- RomM identity-provider integration: a read-only RomM client and adapter
  (token-based auth, capability inspection, provider-relative paths, bounded
  adaptive page sizing) with a CLI surface and GUI configuration, browsing,
  and selected-game identity flow (`crates/archivefs-core/src/identity_source/romm/`,
  `crates/archivefs-cli/src/romm_identity.rs`,
  `crates/archivefs-gui/src/romm_source.rs`, `romm_config.rs`, `romm_browse.rs`,
  `romm_game.rs`).
- RomM cover-art and platform-artwork workflows: RomM cover artwork shown in
  Gamer View, plus managed platform-artwork import with canonical naming and
  33 curated images (#5, #6).
- Cheat Sources GUI (policy Milestone 1), including cheat source health
  surfaced in the GUI, CLI `list`, and `info` output, backed by a read-only
  cache probe (#4, #16).
- DAT Sources GUI Stage 1: registry, validation, and read-only audit, plus
  usability follow-up for warning presentation, audit progress, and
  deterministic cancellation (#7, #11).
- Games-only DAT content policy: a safe, explicit filter that scopes
  structured category/type/content_type trust to No-Intro DATs, with GUI
  selection of the Games-only mode (#29).
- Read-only DAT rename planning: builds a canonical-filename rename plan from
  an audit and the effective matching policy, with collision and symlink
  detection surfaced before anything is proposed for apply (#14).
- Gated DAT rename apply: a durable, journal-backed transaction executor that
  preflights the whole batch, journals it before any mutation, applies
  approved entries one at a time with a no-clobber rename primitive, confirms
  each rename against the filesystem, and supports rollback. Includes crash
  recovery that reconciles in-flight transactions found on restart (#15).
- Classifier-version enforcement on rename apply: a plan built under a
  different classification-rules version is now rejected before any journal
  write or mutation, with a "regenerate the plan" message instead of a silent
  or partial apply (#39).
- Installer ownership hardening: asset ownership is now tracked by SHA-256
  content identity instead of mtime/pathname heuristics, with safer backups,
  stricter manifest parsing (manifest content following the end marker is
  rejected), and foreign-file-collision detection preserved across
  `--replace-foreign` reruns (#38).
- Linux desktop integration: an EmuWiz application icon and desktop launcher
  entry (`io.github.kiehntre.emuwiz`) (#33).
- Platform identity enrichment from RomM and verified DAT evidence, with
  conflict handling when an authoritative platform disagrees with a strong
  independently-derived identity (#17).
- Canonical ROM organisation into a user-configured master ROM root, including
  a GUI page, CLI commands, and journaling that only records
  actually-created platform directories (#18).
- BSFree GameCube cheat install: supported BSFree GameCube codes applied
  through the existing Dolphin adapter (#21).
- BSFree Wii verified-subset cheat install, generalising the existing Dolphin
  dedup analysis to share the Wii pipeline. A distinct, later addition on top
  of the GameCube install path above, not a fold-in of it (#28).
- First-run and empty-state polish: a genuinely missing config is treated as
  first-run rather than an error, with a first-run hint instead of a bare OS
  error (`crates/archivefs-cli/src/main.rs`) (#8, #9).

### Changed

- User-facing product naming changed from ArchiveFS to EmuWiz throughout the
  GUI, CLI help text, and documentation. This is a display-name and
  documentation change only: crate names, binary compatibility aliases,
  `~/.config/archivefs` / `~/.local/share/archivefs` legacy paths,
  `ARCHIVEFS_*` environment variables, and the `archivefs-v*` release
  artifact naming scheme are unchanged and remain supported indefinitely
  (#26, #37).
- App-directory resolution now prefers EmuWiz's own XDG paths
  (`~/.config/emuwiz`, `~/.local/share/emuwiz`) and transparently falls back
  to the legacy ArchiveFS paths when only they exist; resolution is read-only
  and never copies, moves, or overwrites data (#26).
- Beta 1 visual language and UX pass: a consistent friendly primary visual
  language, simplified beginner-gamer presentation, clearer Doctor/audit
  diagnostics, and general beta-era UX cleanup (#19, #20, #22, #23).
- Getting Started Home page: a task-oriented default view for first-run and
  returning users (#10).
- DAT diagnostics now classify severity, group repeated findings by type, and
  show live audit context including duration and a shortened scan folder
  (#12).
- DAT matching policy is now persisted and user-configurable, with an
  Effective Policy Summary shown in the GUI (#13).

### Fixed

- README's `--replace-foreign` description corrected to match actual backup
  behavior.
- `docs/security.md` reconciled with current shipped behavior: source
  archives are described accurately (mount/inspection is read-only; DAT
  rename/apply is a separate, explicitly-gated mutation path with preview,
  classifier-version and generation checks, preflight, a durable journal, and
  no-clobber renames), the config-path section now describes the EmuWiz-first
  with legacy-fallback resolution instead of implying `~/.config/archivefs`
  is the only location, and the document now acknowledges the network- and
  config-writing behavior of the RomM, RetroArch, Dolphin, Xenia,
  GameHacking, and BSFree provider/emulator-profile workflows.
- README's release install walkthrough updated off the stale `v0.5.0-alpha`
  example to the current release process.

### Dependency security

- Updated `quick-xml`, which is used at runtime by `archivefs-core` to parse
  Logiqx DAT/catalogue XML, from 0.39.4 to 0.41.0, resolving
  RUSTSEC-2026-0195 and RUSTSEC-2026-0194 (#3).
  See [`docs/DEPENDENCY_SECURITY.md`](docs/DEPENDENCY_SECURITY.md) for the
  full advisory record.

### Documentation

- Extensive documentation reconciliation with current-main behavior,
  including a loose-ends audit, EmuWiz reference cleanup, and quarantine of
  stale pre-rename material (#35, #37).
- Corrected `docs/security.md` and `SECURITY.md` to accurately describe the
  RomM endpoint policy's DNS-rebinding coverage (validation-time resolution
  reduces but does not eliminate the risk; the actual connection is
  independently re-resolved by `ureq` and not pinned to the validated
  address) and to state precisely that all redirects are refused
  unconditionally, never followed after "validation" (#41).

Note: archive-aware DAT verification, CHD verification, ZIP-member
verification, NES header normalization, B2/split-archive grouping, explicit
wrong-platform diagnostics, and 7z/RAR support remain research-only
(`docs/research/`) and are **not** part of this release.

## v0.7.0 (2026-08-01)

This is the approved v0.7 release scope. See
[`docs/releases/v0.7.0.md`](docs/releases/v0.7.0.md) for installation,
upgrade, workflow, and validation guidance.

### Added

- A canonical registry of 74 platforms and 311 explicit aliases, with
  `Confirmed`, `Probable`, `Ambiguous`, and `Unknown` evidence states and
  manual assignments taking precedence over automatic detection.
- Bounded Atari ST disk recognition: FAT12/geometry validation for raw `.st`
  images and Pasti container validation for `.stx` images. Structurally valid
  `.st` evidence remains non-conclusive unless corroborated; valid `.stx`
  evidence is Atari ST-specific.
- Verified Wii WBFS identity, including the embedded six-character Dolphin
  Game ID, disc number, revision evidence, region, and persisted provenance.
- GameHacking.org providers for PS2, GameCube, and Wii, including offline
  browser-assisted Wii page import and partial-cache matching. The validated
  SMNE01 fixture/page produces 121 parsed entries: 98 supported and 23 blocked
  or unknown.
- Optional BSFree Archive source lifecycle: explicit download or local import,
  strict schema validation, immutable/query-only SQLite access, 44 explicit
  system mappings through the canonical registry, 11 device classifications,
  bounded search/pagination, GUI browsing, and typed CLI JSON.
- Doctor Stages 1A, 1B, and 1C-A: read-only findings, narrowly bound safe
  repairs, environment checks, storage/profile diagnostics, managed-cheat
  diagnostics, and grouped historical mount results.

### Improved

- Gamer View now has a fixed-height platform shelf with Previous/Next controls,
  wheel, trackpad, drag, keyboard, and TV/Moonlight-friendly navigation.
- Dolphin profile resolution distinguishes running and manually selected
  profiles, recognises AppImage `-u`/`--user` roots, and uses the Flatpak
  data-tree `GameSettings` location.
- Cheat installation for supported PS2, GameCube, and Wii formats uses explicit
  preview, atomic application, verification, History, managed-only removal,
  and Undo while preserving unrelated emulator configuration.
- Platform detection reads signatures through symlinks only when both link and
  resolved target satisfy the configured trusted-root policy.
- Large repeated Doctor histories are grouped without discarding their full
  structured CLI/JSON findings.

### Fixed

- `RESOURCE.GEN` in ScummVM game folders no longer becomes Mega Drive merely
  because `.gen` is shared.
- Loose PS2 disc images and symlinked in-root ISOs retain verified identity
  rather than relying on filenames.
- Wii cached matching is one-shot and generation-keyed, so repeated GUI frames
  cannot respawn an endless high-CPU lookup.
- Wii browser-assisted imports can bootstrap a trusted single-game partial
  cache without requiring a complete online catalogue crawl.
- Dolphin Flatpak targets resolve under
  `~/.var/app/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu/data/dolphin-emu` rather than the
  unrelated configuration tree.

### Safety

- Source archives, ROMs, and disc images remain read-only. Structural disk
  inspection is cancellable and limited to 64 KiB total, 1 KiB per read, a
  32 KiB maximum offset, a 4 MiB raw-floppy cap, and a 32 MiB STX cap.
- `DetectionEvidence.conclusive` explicitly separates valid structure from
  evidence that uniquely settles a platform; valid FAT12 alone never becomes
  an automatic exact Atari ST claim.
- GameHacking Cloudflare/challenge responses are typed, never cached as valid
  content, and fall back to exact cached data without retry loops.
- BSFree performs no automatic network access, opens its database read-only and
  query-only, never migrates it, and exposes no installation action in Stage 1.
- Schema remains version 6 with migrations exactly `0001` through `0006`.

### Manual validation

- The `v0.7.0-rc.1` artifact passed real Sunshine desktop GUI testing before
  promotion to this stable release.
- Gamer View's fixed-height platform shelf, card alignment, and navigation
  controls were verified on the real desktop.
- Atari ST presentation was verified with the integrated `.st`/`.stx`
  detection behavior.
- BSFree was verified as Ready and browse-only, with no BSFree Install action.

### Known limitations

- BSFree is browse-only. It neither converts nor installs codes, and its
  platform/title matching may return several ambiguous revisions.
- Malformed, cracked, padded, or loader-modified Atari ST `.st` images whose
  FAT12 geometry cannot be verified remain Probable from contextual/extension
  evidence rather than being promoted.
- ZIP-contained identity, CHD, RVZ, and generic BIN identity remain incomplete
  for some platforms and layouts.
- Some emulator-specific cheat formats and destinations remain unsupported;
  ambiguous, unknown, placeholder-bearing, revision-mismatched, or unsupported
  master-code entries remain non-installable.
- Stored historical platform findings may retain their old classification
  until the relevant source is rescanned.
- Symlink signature scanning is available only through trusted-root-aware
  inspection paths; arbitrary or escaping symlinks remain refused.

## v0.7.0-rc.1 (historical candidate)

Commit `113b508bd6839309cfd9e25d054094cc27112860` was the manually approved
release candidate promoted to v0.7.0. Its original candidate notes remain at
[`docs/releases/v0.7.0-rc.1.md`](docs/releases/v0.7.0-rc.1.md).

## Historical pre-RC integration notes

### Gamer View

- Platform Artwork Pack v1 replaces temporary exact-platform abstract glyphs
  with 17 original/generated PNG hardware illustrations embedded in the GUI
  executable. Exact, case-insensitive aliases cover Acorn Archimedes, Amiga,
  Dreamcast, Game Boy, GameCube, Mega Drive/Genesis, Nintendo 64, PlayStation
  1/2/3, Saturn, SNES/Super Famicom, Switch, Wii, Wii U, Xbox, and Xbox 360.
- Artwork resolution is now valid custom local PNG, exact bundled PNG,
  category glyph, then Unknown. Custom safety limits and precedence are
  unchanged; bundled images require neither network access nor installed
  source-tree files and decoded textures are cached.
- The one-row responsive platform shelf, filtering, selected/focus states,
  labels, counts, tooltips, and narrow-window behavior remain unchanged.
- Platform hardware illustrations are now prominent, and compact game rows
  again show cached artwork: local per-game PNG, platform artwork, then
  Unknown.
- Increased hardware illustrations to 108 pixels in 142-pixel cards and game
  thumbnails to 56 pixels in compact 64-pixel rows after manual readability
  testing, without cropping or stretching transparent PNGs.

### Cheats & Mods

- GameHacking native PCSX2 section headers, authors, and multiline
  descriptions are now retained, so selectable entries show their real cheat
  names and notes instead of generic `Cheat N` placeholders.

- Replaced the incomplete single-page GameHacking PS2 lookup with a resumable,
  rate-limited local index catalogue covering every numbered public PS2 index
  page. Runtime matching now prioritizes normalized serial/CRC/region evidence;
  title-only and ambiguous results are shown for explicit confirmation before
  one native PCSX2 export is requested. Downloaded index/catalogue data remains
  private cache data and is not shipped or committed.

- Added the general GameHacking.org provider core with PS2/PCSX2 as its first
  adapter. It checks one selected local-library game at a time, fails closed on
  serial/CRC/region conflicts, caches public pages and native PNACH exports,
  preserves author/description/source provenance, and rate-limits bounded
  fixed-origin HTTPS requests.
- Selected GameHacking.org cheats can be previewed and installed under the
  verified local PCSX2 CRC through ArchiveFS's existing confirmation, backup,
  journal, and Undo transaction flow. No crawler, automatic fetch, PNACH
  conversion, ROM modification, or user-file overwrite without confirmation
  was added.
- GameHacking HTML no longer requires strict UTF-8: declared HTTP charsets are
  honoured and other pages use safe lossy decoding while original response
  bytes remain unchanged in the cache.

### Documentation

- Expanded the platform artwork manifest with every bundled filename, alias,
  encoded size, alpha/padding inspection, runtime format, offline guarantee,
  provenance statement, fallback behavior, and rejection record.
- Added `docs/GAMEHACKING_PROVIDER.md` covering provider scope, identity gates,
  caching, rate limiting, provenance, native export, and future adapters.

## v0.7.0-alpha (historical candidate notes; not tagged)

See [`docs/releases/v0.7.0-alpha.md`](docs/releases/v0.7.0-alpha.md) for the
full narrative release notes, installation instructions, and manual QA
summary. This entry groups the same changes by area. The published annotated
tag peels to source commit `908c00da23303216cd28563a00b4ec835bc87207`.

### Gamer View

- New default navigation shell: a single-screen Gamer View (search,
  platform-first game list, selected-game action panel) alongside the
  existing, fully-preserved Advanced View. Reached via a small gear menu
  from Gamer View; Advanced View always shows an obvious "Return to Gamer
  View" action.
- A visual platform picker (small original vector glyphs, name, and game
  count per platform) replaces the earlier plain text filter chips, with
  category fallbacks (console, handheld, computer, arcade, optical-disc,
  cartridge, unknown) for platforms without dedicated artwork.
- An optional custom-artwork directory can override built-in artwork with
  the user's own local PNG files, matched by canonical platform id
  (`gamecube.png`, `ps2.png`, etc.); bounded decode limits (1 MiB
  file size, 1024x1024 pixels) and safe fallback to the built-in glyph on
  any rejection or malformed file.
- The game list uses the full remaining window height and scrolls
  independently of the fixed selected-game panel; selected rows have
  stronger visual emphasis, and the action panel visually separates the
  primary action (Mount/Unmount) from secondary actions (Cheats & Mods,
  Details, Open location) and Undo.
- Selecting Cheats & Mods from Gamer View opens the existing workflow
  already scoped to the selected game (no separate archive picker), with
  an explicit "Back to games" action.

### Cheats & Mods

- Direct read-only discovery for GameCube/Wii `.iso`, `.gcm`, `.gcz`,
  `.rvz`, `.wbfs`, and `.ciso`, preserving visibility when exact identity is
  unavailable.
- Canonical platform resolution and persistent source-level assignments
  with explicit preview and safe reclassification.
- A new read-only `cheat-provider-coverage` CLI command audits existing
  Dolphin and RetroArch catalogue coverage for a bounded, exact selection
  of up to 32 archive IDs, reporting compatible/rejected/duplicate/conflict
  counts and honest no-match reasons without exposing local paths. See
  [`docs/CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md`](docs/CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md).

### Emulator adapters

- Xenia Canary patch lookup and confirmed installation/rollback.
- Dolphin Gecko definitions can be installed and rolled back through the
  verified transaction engine; Gecko and Action Replay content are
  distinguished, and only Gecko is ever installed through the approved
  provider path.
- PCSX2: core identity (verified executable CRC, optional serial/region),
  profile discovery, a strict PNACH parser/renderer, and a
  transaction-backed install/Undo path are now implemented in
  `archivefs-core`, proven by an automated end-to-end test suite. **This is
  not yet reachable from the CLI or the GUI** - the GUI's PCSX2 workflow
  still shows "installation unavailable" (recognition-only wiring was
  added this release), and no CLI subcommand exists for it yet. No
  approved downloadable ordinary-cheat catalogue is bundled for PCSX2.

### Safety and Undo

- Every Cheats & Mods install across RetroArch, Dolphin, and Xenia goes
  through the same shared transaction engine: explicit preview, separate
  confirmation, verified backup before any replacement, a written journal,
  and preview-then-confirm rollback.
- An in-flight Cheats & Mods transaction, and a rollback preview/review in
  progress, both now survive switching between Gamer View and Advanced
  View or navigating away and back - neither is silently reset just
  because a different page is rendered.
- Selection-generation guards and consistent focused/multi-selection
  clearing across platform-filter changes prevent an async result for one
  game from being applied to a different, later-selected game.
- Every bulk action (Mount All, Unmount All, missing-entry removal, "Mount
  selected", bulk platform assignment/clear) now shows a preview and the
  exact item count before any confirmation; 1-25 items use a normal
  confirmation, more than 25 requires typing the exact count. Mount All is
  not reachable from Gamer View at all.

### Coverage reporting

- `cheat-provider-coverage` (see "Cheats & Mods" above) is a read-only,
  bounded audit distinct from installation: it reports what an *existing*
  local catalogue can match today, with fail-closed region/revision
  handling, and makes no gameplay-coverage claim. See
  [`docs/CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md`](docs/CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md) for
  exactly what a zero-match can mean for each provider.

### Release engineering

- A canonical, locally runnable release builder and independent artifact
  verifier with deterministic archive metadata, privacy checks, malformed-
  artifact rejection, version consistency, and two-build reproducibility
  proof.
- Split pull-request CI gates for formatting, Clippy, workspace tests,
  locked release builds, dependency/security audit, artifact verification,
  and reproducibility. CI candidates are retained for 14 days and are not
  published as releases.

### Dependency security

- Updated the `eframe`/`egui` GUI dependency family from 0.32.3 to 0.34.3,
  removing the unmaintained `ttf-parser`/`owned_ttf_parser`/`ab_glyph`
  font-parsing chain entirely (RUSTSEC-2026-0192).
- Updated `quick-xml`, which is used at runtime by `archivefs-core` to parse
  Logiqx DAT/catalogue XML, from 0.39.4 to 0.41.0, resolving
  RUSTSEC-2026-0195 and RUSTSEC-2026-0194.
- Both online and cached `cargo audit` runs are clean with no advisory
  ignore added. See [`docs/DEPENDENCY_SECURITY.md`](docs/DEPENDENCY_SECURITY.md).

### Documentation

- Added [`docs/GUI_NAVIGATION_RESET_DESIGN.md`](docs/GUI_NAVIGATION_RESET_DESIGN.md),
  [`docs/PLATFORM_ARTWORK.md`](docs/PLATFORM_ARTWORK.md),
  [`docs/PCSX2_CHEAT_ADAPTER.md`](docs/PCSX2_CHEAT_ADAPTER.md),
  [`docs/CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md`](docs/CHEAT_PROVIDER_COVERAGE.md),
  [`docs/DEPENDENCY_SECURITY.md`](docs/DEPENDENCY_SECURITY.md), and
  [`docs/releases/v0.7.0-alpha.md`](docs/releases/v0.7.0-alpha.md).

### Changed

- Platform selection is shared by Library, Mount, and Cheats & Mods, and
  now also drives Gamer View's platform picker.
- Beginner-facing cheat and patch states use plain language; diagnostics
  remain available under Details.

### Known limitations

- PCSX2 install/Undo exists only in `archivefs-core` today - not reachable
  from the CLI or GUI (see "Emulator adapters" above); no approved
  downloadable ordinary-cheat catalogue is bundled.
- Dolphin and RetroArch catalogue coverage is not universal and varies by
  game, platform, region, and revision evidence; ambiguous/tied RetroArch
  matches remain fail-closed rather than guessed.
- Custom platform artwork supports local PNG only; runtime SVG rendering of
  the on-disk built-in `.svg` assets (and of a custom SVG override) remains
  deferred - built-in artwork renders as a native vector glyph instead.
- Native Wayland GUI startup has not been manually proven in the current
  development/QA environment (only X11 was available); it is not claimed
  as manually tested.
- Some `egui` 0.34 deprecated compatibility entry points remain in use,
  behind an explicit, documented allowance - migrating them to the
  preferred native APIs is deferred to a dedicated follow-up.
- Mount Queue's own confirmation dialog does not yet have the >25
  typed-count escalation described above under "Safety and Undo" (Mount
  All, Unmount All, and the other listed bulk actions do).
- The GUI-foundation presentation/safety modules
  (`view_mode`/`status_wording`/`game_presentation`/`bulk_confirmation`/
  `selection_guard`) are integrated into the codebase but are not yet
  consumed by the active, already-tested inline Gamer View implementation.
- RVZ identity inspection is bounded and requires a readable direct header;
  malformed or unsupported layouts remain visible with an honest terminal
  status instead of being hidden or left loading.
- A database opened by this build is migrated forward to schema 5. Older
  builds reject that schema, so application downgrade requires a
  pre-upgrade database copy; in-place downgrade is not supported.

## v0.6.0-alpha (development baseline; not tagged)

Historical development baseline merged after `v0.5.0-alpha`; it was not tagged
before the v0.7 integration work began. See
[`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.6.0-alpha.md`](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.6.0-alpha.md) for
a narrative overview and
[`docs/MANUAL_QA_v0.6.0-alpha.md`](docs/MANUAL_QA_v0.6.0-alpha.md) for the
manual acceptance plan.

### Added

- **Shared verified game identity**: bounded, read-only PS2/GameCube/Wii
  disc-identity extraction (product code, Game ID, revision, and, for PS2,
  PCSX2's executable CRC) from a local ISO or single-ISO ZIP, shown as an
  explicit `Verified`/`Candidate`/`Missing`/etc. evidence state rather than a
  guessed name. Feeds exact matching in the PCSX2 and Dolphin adapters. See
  [`docs/SHARED_GAME_IDENTITY.md`](docs/SHARED_GAME_IDENTITY.md).
- **Shared read-only Cheats & Mods preview and conflict detection** across
  all three adapters: a typed `Install new` / `Already installed` /
  `Replace different` / `Conflict` / `Ambiguous` / etc. report with no apply
  path of its own. See
  [`docs/SHARED_CHEAT_PREVIEW.md`](docs/SHARED_CHEAT_PREVIEW.md).
- **Shared safe apply, backup, journal, history, and rollback foundation**: a
  bounded transaction pipeline with atomic temp-file-then-rename writes,
  verified never-overwritten backups before any replacement, schema-versioned
  journals, truthful partial-success reporting, and rollback that blocks on
  user-modified content or a missing/changed backup. See
  [`docs/SHARED_SAFE_APPLY_ROLLBACK.md`](docs/SHARED_SAFE_APPLY_ROLLBACK.md).
- **RetroArch GUI apply, history, and rollback**: an eligible exact or
  approved-strong RetroArch trusted-catalogue match can now be applied
  through the shared transaction engine directly from Cheats & Mods -
  preview, explicit confirmation (with a separate, non-preselected
  replacement approval), background execution, and a result shown as
  success, partial success, or failure. History & Logs can open the exact
  operation and preview/confirm its rollback. PCSX2 and Dolphin remain
  preview-only - see [`docs/RETROARCH_GUI_APPLY_HISTORY.md`](docs/RETROARCH_GUI_APPLY_HISTORY.md).
- **RetroArch trusted catalogue download and management**: the Sources page
  now owns catalogue retrieval end-to-end - Download/Update/Verify with an
  explicit review-then-confirm dialog before any network access, background
  retrieval with cancellation, and an activated snapshot that Cheats & Mods
  matches against immediately. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md).
- **Recently Found**: a new navigation page listing only the newest
  completed scan's added archives, in exact path order, backed by a
  persistent append-only observation log and bounded to 10,000 entries with
  explicit truncation reporting. Reuses the existing Library table
  (search/filter/sort/selection all remain available). See
  [`docs/LIBRARY_SCAN_USABILITY.md`](docs/LIBRARY_SCAN_USABILITY.md).
- **Mega Drive/Genesis loose-ROM recognition**: `.gen`/`.smd` files are
  recognized case-insensitively; ambiguous `.md`/`.bin` files are recognized
  only when located under an exactly-named Mega Drive/Genesis folder
  component (`megadrive`, `mega-drive`, `genesis`, `sega-genesis`, and
  similar aliases), never from the filename alone - so an unrelated
  `README.md` outside such a folder is never imported. See
  [`docs/LIBRARY_SCAN_USABILITY.md`](docs/LIBRARY_SCAN_USABILITY.md).

### Changed

- Settings, Doctor, About, Sources, Library Views, and History & Logs now
  share one scrollable-page wrapper supporting mouse wheel, touchpad, Page
  Up/Down, Home, and End, recalculated on resize or Activity-panel
  expansion. Cheats & Mods retains its own scroll region and does not yet
  use this wrapper - see Known limitations.
- Library database schema version 4 adds persistent per-scan counters for
  unchanged, skipped-unsupported, and skipped-ambiguous files, so scan
  summaries can report them without generating one activity event per file.

### Security

- The shared apply pipeline reopens every source no-follow, rejects symlink
  components and special files, and compares device/inode/size/mtime around
  every read before trusting a digest.
- Every shared-apply transaction acquires an exclusive advisory lock on its
  one destination root (5-second timeout, released on drop), and one
  transaction always has exactly one destination root, so lock ordering is
  deadlock-free by construction.
- A confirmed apply is bound to a SHA-256 plan ID covering the exact
  adapter, archive, identity, profile, destination, and action set; any
  context change between preview and confirmation fails closed rather than
  silently re-planning.
- A journal-write failure that happens *after* a destination write already
  succeeded is reported as `partial_failure`, never as silent success or an
  opaque hard failure.
- Rollback re-derives a fresh preview immediately before acting and blocks
  on user-modified destination content, a missing or changed backup, or an
  already-completed rollback (enforced by a separate, non-overwritable
  rollback marker).
- RetroArch catalogue Download/Update never touches the network until the
  user explicitly confirms a review dialog naming the provider and the
  exact ArchiveFS-managed destination; cancelling at any point before that
  confirmation writes nothing and leaves the previously active snapshot,
  if any, unchanged.

### Fixed

- **RetroArch catalogue parse-tolerance**: an individual malformed or
  unsupported entry in a downloaded trusted catalogue no longer affects
  validation of the whole snapshot. A catalogue that parses with a bounded
  number of excluded entries is now reported as usable
  (`CatalogueIndexState::UsablePartial`), with each excluded entry recorded
  individually rather than failing the entire snapshot.
- **Libretro catalogue archive size limits raised**: the per-entry limit is
  now 256 MiB (up from 64 MiB) and the total expanded-archive limit is now
  1 GiB (up from 256 MiB), matching the real size of the official
  `libretro-database` catalogue.
- **Stale Cheats & Mods "Stage 3" copy removed.** The GUI no longer shows
  "Archive matching and cheat installation are not yet implemented in this
  GUI workflow" anywhere - that copy predated RetroArch matching/apply and
  was left over by mistake.

### Known limitations

- PCSX2 and Dolphin remain **preview-only**: both have real verified
  identity and real read-only inspection of emulator-managed files, but
  neither has an approved, independently materialized source artifact to
  apply from, so neither offers Install/Apply/Enable/Disable/Rollback
  anywhere in the GUI.
- Mods remain planned and are not implemented; the Mods section of Cheats &
  Mods is a labelled placeholder, not a working feature.
- There is no cancellation once a shared-apply write has actually begun -
  only before it starts.
- Cheats & Mods does not yet use the shared scrollable-page keyboard
  wrapper the other listed pages use.
- Operation history in the GUI's History & Logs page remains in-memory for
  the current session; it is not yet persisted to disk.
- No general-purpose local or community cheat/mod import inspection
  pipeline exists; only the fixed, reviewed RetroArch trusted-source list
  can be fetched, never an arbitrary or user-supplied URL.

## v0.5.0-alpha

Released. `Cargo.toml` reads `0.5.0-alpha` and the `v0.5.0-alpha` tag exists.
See [`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md`](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md)
for the narrative overview and
[`docs/MANUAL_QA_v0.5.0-alpha.md`](docs/MANUAL_QA_v0.5.0-alpha.md) for the
manual acceptance plan used at the time.

Cheats & Mods reached its intended **three read-only emulator adapters**:
RetroArch, PCSX2, and Dolphin. Adapter expansion paused here - see
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md#medium-term-plans).

### Added

- **Three-adapter Cheats & Mods architecture.** Cheats & Mods now
  integrates three read-only emulator adapters - RetroArch, PCSX2, and
  Dolphin - each gated to its own platform(s) with explicit profile
  selection and no install/apply/rollback control anywhere. This is the
  intended stopping point for adapter expansion for now - see
  [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md#medium-term-plans).
- Read-only PCSX2 profile and PNACH inspection in Cheats & Mods: discovers
  native, Flatpak, and explicitly supplied portable PCSX2 profiles, and
  inspects existing `cheats`/`cheats_ws`/`patches` directories and `.pnach`
  files - read-only, nothing written or created. Exact matching requires a
  separately verified PCSX2 executable CRC, which ArchiveFS does not yet
  have, so no exact match is ever claimed. No Install, Apply, Enable,
  Disable, or rollback control exists. See "PCSX2 read-only adapter" in
  [`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md`](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md)
  for full detail.
- Read-only Dolphin profile and Game INI inspection in Cheats & Mods:
  discovers native, Flatpak, and explicitly supplied Dolphin configuration
  roots, and inspects existing `GameSettings/*.ini` files for GameCube/Wii
  archives - read-only, nothing written or created, and no texture pack,
  graphics mod, resource pack, or Riivolution asset is inspected. Exact
  matching requires a separately verified Dolphin Game ID, which ArchiveFS
  does not yet have, so no exact match is ever claimed. No Install, Apply,
  Enable, Disable, or rollback control exists. See "Dolphin read-only
  adapter" in
  [`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md`](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md)
  for full detail.
- Redesigned desktop GUI navigation: `Mount`, `Selected`, `Active Mounts`,
  `Doctor`, `History & Logs`, `Settings`, and `About` are now dedicated
  pages, alongside the existing `Library`, `Sources`, `Health`,
  `Duplicates`, and `Library Views` pages. Mount adds a destination
  preview and an explicit mount queue reviewed on Selected before
  anything is mounted; Active Mounts adds confirmed normal unmount;
  Doctor gains a check summary and "Copy report"; History & Logs gains
  operation/result filtering, sorting, and log export; Settings and
  About surface backend-supported configuration, environment, and
  version information read-only. A shared visual system (`archivefs-gui`'s
  `ui` module: typed status badges, cards, buttons, empty/loading states,
  and a responsive page-width policy for laptop through ultrawide
  displays) replaced page-by-page ad hoc styling after an internal
  adversarial audit found the initial integration functionally sound but
  not visually release-ready; see `docs/FABLE_PROGRESS.md` and
  `docs/INTEGRATED_GUI_AUDIT.md` for that audit and rescue record.
- A first-class **Cheats & Mods** GUI workspace (`archivefs-gui`) that
  keeps exact archive context, RetroArch profile discovery, and trusted
  cheat-catalogue retrieval together in one page. It clearly labels
  matching, installation, and mod support as not yet available rather
  than hiding or fabricating those steps.
- A user-facing Cheats & Mods trust and safety model: every source is
  presented as **Trusted**, **Unverified**, or **Blocked**, with local
  safety scanning explicitly labelled planned/unavailable rather than
  silently absent. See
  [`docs/CHEATS_MODS_SAFETY.md`](docs/CHEATS_MODS_SAFETY.md) and the new
  [`docs/CHEATS_MODS_USER_POLICY.md`](docs/CHEATS_MODS_USER_POLICY.md).
- Guided RetroArch cheat setup (`retroarch-cheat-setup`): discovers safe
  native, Flatpak, and verified portable profiles, previews conservative
  matches against a local or trusted-source catalogue, and delegates
  approved changes to a journaled installer. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SETUP.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SETUP.md).
- A safe RetroArch cheat installer and journal-driven rollback
  (`retroarch-cheat-rollback`), with destination path safety checks,
  backups before any replacement, and read-only installation history and
  single-run inspection (`retroarch-cheat-history`,
  `retroarch-cheat-inspect`). See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_INSTALL.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_INSTALL.md),
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_ROLLBACK.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_ROLLBACK.md), and
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_HISTORY.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_HISTORY.md).
- Trusted RetroArch cheat-catalogue retrieval
  (`retroarch-cheat-source-list`, `-fetch`, `-inspect`): a fixed,
  reviewed list of sources only - no arbitrary or user-supplied URLs -
  fetched over certificate-validated HTTPS into a bounded, validated,
  immutable local snapshot with SHA-256 digest and freshness reporting,
  with offline reuse of a previously fetched snapshot. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md) and
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CATALOGUE.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CATALOGUE.md).
- Cheat-source cache maintenance: snapshot inventory, verification,
  pin/unpin, and preview-first pruning that keeps current, last-known-good,
  pinned, and unverifiable snapshots protected from deletion. All cache
  access across processes is coordinated by one bounded, timing-out
  advisory file lock. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CACHE_MAINTENANCE.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CACHE_MAINTENANCE.md)
  and
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CACHE_LOCKING.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CACHE_LOCKING.md).
- Database diagnostics now distinguish SQLite hot-header evidence, zeroed and
  truncated non-hot journals, malformed headers, and the extended
  `SQLITE_READONLY_ROLLBACK` recovery-required result. Catalogue status, list,
  health, alias/source/list-view previews, and normal GUI catalogue loading use
  the explicit read-only database path. The GUI retains scan worker handles,
  refuses to replace a scan already in progress, and waits for scan/source
  workers during normal shutdown; SQLite durability remains unchanged.
- `database-check` and `database-check --json`: bounded, structured,
  explicitly read-only SQLite health diagnostics with main-file metadata,
  rollback-journal/WAL/SHM evidence, journal mode, schema version,
  `quick_check`, and stable error classifications. The command never creates,
  migrates, repairs, checkpoints, or deletes database files. See
  [`docs/DATABASE_RECOVERY.md`](docs/DATABASE_RECOVERY.md).

- Managed library views: named, symlink-based organized views of the
  catalogue (`view list`, `view preview`, `view apply`, `view repair`,
  `view remove`), backed by `~/.config/archivefs/library_views.json` and a
  per-view JSON manifest under `~/.local/share/archivefs/library_views/` that
  tracks every symlink ArchiveFS created so `repair`/`remove` only ever touch
  paths ArchiveFS itself manages.
- Read-only PCSX2 patch-preview foundation (`pcsx2-patch-preview`): fetches a
  single compiled-in PCSX2 patch metadata endpoint into bounded memory and
  prints native/Flatpak installation candidates as a non-executable advisory
  plan. This is metadata-only preview - it does not download, verify,
  install, or enable any patch, and does not write anything to disk.
- An emulator-neutral patch adapter boundary (`EmulatorAdapter` trait and
  supporting types in `archivefs-core::patch_manager::adapter`), extracted
  from the PCSX2-specific code so future emulator adapters can be added
  without redesigning the shared orchestration. `ReadOnlyPcsx2Adapter` is
  currently the only implementation of this trait.
- An archive content inspector (`archivefs-core::inspector`) that classifies
  entries inside a supported archive without extracting it, and improvements
  to mount-readiness checks that use it.
- Expanded canonical retro platform recognition (additional entries in the
  folder-name platform alias table and related database/GUI support).
- A repository maintenance script (`scripts/barry-checkpoint.sh`) and its
  tests for automated project checkpointing. This is a development/tooling
  addition, not a user-facing ArchiveFS capability.
- `DEDICATION.md`, linked from the bottom of `README.md`.
- Read-only RetroArch environment discovery (`retroarch-environment`):
  detects a native and a Flatpak (user- and system-scope) RetroArch profile,
  locates and parses `retroarch.cfg` for twelve configured path purposes
  (System, Cores, CoreInfo, Saves, SaveStates, Playlists, Shaders, Overlays,
  Thumbnails, JoypadAutoconfig, Database, Cheats), and inventories installed
  Linux cores (`*_libretro.so`) plus their optional `.info` metadata. This is
  a sibling to the patch-preview adapter boundary, not part of it - see
  [`docs/RETROARCH_ENVIRONMENT.md`](docs/RETROARCH_ENVIRONMENT.md). Strictly
  read-only: no file is created, modified, or deleted; no process is
  spawned; no network call is made; no core is loaded.
- A read-only RetroArch cheat/patch destination preview
  (`retroarch-patch-preview`): for every present catalogue archive,
  previews per-game `.cht` cheat destinations (gated on exactly one
  installed core supporting the archive's own file extension) and IPS/
  BPS/UPS/Xdelta soft-patch sibling destinations, across every discovered
  RetroArch profile. Builds directly on the RetroArch environment
  discovery above rather than rediscovering any path, and makes no
  network call - unlike PCSX2, no RetroArch metadata source has been
  reviewed for this milestone. Does not implement `EmulatorAdapter` or
  produce an `AdvisoryPatchPlan`: RetroArch's multi-root, core-selection-
  ambiguous shape does not fit that PCSX2-specific trait/type, so this is
  a separate, narrowly-scoped `RetroArchAdvisoryPlan` instead. No PCSX2
  type, plan ID, JSON shape, or CLI output was changed. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_PATCH_PREVIEW.md`](docs/RETROARCH_PATCH_PREVIEW.md).
- A bounded, read-only inventory of existing RetroArch `.cht`, `.ips`,
  `.bps`, `.ups`, and `.xdelta` artifacts, included in
  `retroarch-patch-preview` human and JSON output. It reports empty and
  occupied expected destinations plus duplicate, conflicting, ambiguous,
  and orphaned files; parses only bounded non-executable `.cht` metadata;
  and never follows artifact symlinks or modifies a file. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md`](docs/RETROARCH_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md).
- Read-only RetroArch playlist identity and content matching: discovers
  and parses modern JSON `.lpl` playlist files from the already-discovered
  Playlists directory (bounded at 4 MiB per file, 1024 files and 65536
  total entries per profile) and uses them as additional evidence in
  `retroarch-patch-preview` - a playlist entry's own resolved content path,
  core association, and database name can now upgrade an `AmbiguousCore`/
  `UnsupportedNoCore` result to a precise `ExactCore` one when the evidence
  is unambiguous, without ever downgrading an already-correct extension-
  based match. No playlist is ever written, repaired, or created, and the
  binary `.rdb` database is never parsed. Purely additive to both
  `retroarch-environment --json` and `retroarch-patch-preview --json`
  (`format_version` stays `1` on each, per this project's documented JSON
  policy of allowing new fields without a version bump). See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_PLAYLISTS.md`](docs/RETROARCH_PLAYLISTS.md).
- Read-only RetroArch AppImage detection: scans a fixed set of default
  locations (`~/Applications`, `~/.local/bin`,
  `~/.local/share/applications`, `~/AppImages`, `~/bin`) and your XDG
  desktop-entry directories for `.desktop` files, entirely read-only and
  non-recursive, and feeds any detected AppImage into the existing
  environment/playlist/patch-preview pipeline. An AppImage sharing the
  native profile's own configuration (the common case) is attached to the
  existing native profile's new `app_images` field with no new profile
  created; an AppImage with verified evidence of a genuinely distinct
  configuration (the official AppImage-runtime portable-mode
  `.home`/`.config` sibling-directory convention, or an explicit
  `-c`/`--config` in its desktop launcher) gets its own profile instead,
  never a duplicate. Never executes, mounts, extracts, or FUSE-mounts an
  AppImage; never invokes an external tool; never writes or modifies an
  AppImage or `.desktop` file. Because a distinct-configuration AppImage
  inserts a 4th `profiles[]` entry between native and Flatpak/user,
  `retroarch-environment --json`'s `format_version` moves from `1` to `2`;
  `retroarch-patch-preview` needed no matching/orchestration changes at
  all, since it already iterates `environment.profiles` generically. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_APPIMAGE.md`](docs/RETROARCH_APPIMAGE.md).

### Changed

- Rust CI reproducibility: the project now pins an exact Rust toolchain
  (`1.97.1`) via `rust-toolchain.toml`, and both `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  and `.github/workflows/release.yml` install that exact version explicitly
  instead of a floating `stable` channel. See the
  [Rust toolchain policy](CONTRIBUTING.md#rust-toolchain-policy) in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` for why.
- The desktop GUI's primary navigation moved from a single top tab bar to
  a persistent left-hand page list covering every destination above, with
  `Health`, `Duplicates`, and `Library Views` kept reachable as a
  secondary group rather than removed.

### Security

- Mount and unmount now verify their own postcondition instead of trusting
  the external `ratarmount`/unmount command's exit status alone: a mount is
  only reported successful if the destination is actually present in
  `/proc/self/mountinfo` afterward, and an unmount is only reported
  successful once the mount has actually disappeared.
- Source-folder scanning requires an explicit, absolute, non-root path,
  rejects duplicate or nested configured roots, refuses symlink path
  components, and never follows a symlink entry encountered below a valid
  root. Recursive scans are bounded by entry-count and depth limits.
- Catalogue refreshes now run inside one SQLite write transaction with a
  savepoint per source folder: a single failing source rolls back only its
  own writes and is recorded truthfully, a fatal failure rolls back the
  entire refresh, and a killed process can never leave a half-updated
  catalogue visible to the next read.
- Every process sharing a RetroArch cheat-source cache root now
  coordinates through one exclusive, directory-identity-based advisory
  lock with a deterministic five-second timeout - covering listing,
  inspection, retrieval, publication, inventory, verification, pinning,
  and pruning - instead of relying on filesystem timing alone. Locking is
  additional defense; every prune candidate is still independently
  revalidated (pin state, current pointer, hash, path, symlinks) at
  execution time regardless of the lock.
- Non-UTF-8 source-folder and archive-path handling was hardened
  end-to-end: a non-UTF-8 source root is rejected at the config boundary
  rather than silently altered, while archive names below a valid source
  remain exact, byte-preserving values throughout scanning and the
  catalogue.

### Fixed

- Bounded emulator-environment directory listings now use
  `symlink_metadata` directly, preserving their documented
  final-component no-follow contract even when a symlink target exists.
- An ambiguous float literal (`egui::Stroke::new(2.0, stroke_color)`) that a
  newer Rust compiler's stricter lint started rejecting was made explicit
  (`2.0_f32`). This was a compiler-drift break, not a logic change: the code
  had been correct and passing CI until an unpinned `stable` toolchain moved
  out from under it.
- The GUI's trusted cheat-source listing now correctly propagates a cache
  read/lock failure as an error message instead of a type mismatch that
  the cache-locking change above introduced when source listing became
  fallible.

### Known limitations

- RetroArch cheat **matching**, **installation**, and **rollback** are
  fully implemented and tested at the CLI/core level, but are **not**
  reachable from the GUI's Cheats & Mods workspace yet - only profile
  discovery and trusted catalogue retrieval are. The GUI states this
  explicitly rather than hiding the steps.
- Cache pin/unpin and prune controls exist at the CLI/core level but have
  no GUI surface yet.
- There is no general-purpose local or community cheat/mod import
  inspection pipeline yet. Local safety scanning is presented in the GUI
  as planned/unavailable, with no toggle that would pretend to change
  protection.
- Arbitrary or user-supplied cheat-source URLs are not accepted anywhere;
  only the fixed, reviewed trusted-source list can be fetched.
- Mod installation and emulator-specific mod adapters do not exist yet;
  the Mods section of the Cheats & Mods workspace is a labelled
  placeholder.
- Operation history in the GUI's History & Logs page remains in-memory
  for the current session; it is not yet persisted to disk.
- Settings remains read-only for backend-supported configuration;
  appearance/density and other GUI-only preferences are not yet editable,
  and there is no update-check mechanism.
- PCSX2's exact CRC matching remains deferred (requires a separately
  verified PCSX2 executable CRC, which ArchiveFS does not yet have), and
  there is no PCSX2 preview, installation, or rollback support.
- Dolphin's exact matching remains deferred (requires a separately verified
  Dolphin Game ID, which ArchiveFS does not yet have), there is no
  texture-pack, graphics-mod, resource-pack, or Riivolution-asset
  inspection, and there is no Dolphin installation or rollback support. A
  Nobara-specific manual QA run for the Dolphin adapter remains
  outstanding (validated on Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS at merge time).
- Further emulator adapter expansion beyond RetroArch/PCSX2/Dolphin is
  paused for now - see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md#medium-term-plans).

## v0.4.3-alpha

### Added

- Multi-source management: `sources`, `sources scan-all`, `source add`,
  `source enable`, `source disable`, `source scan`, and `source remove`
  (with `--keep-catalogue`/`--remove-catalogue`), plus a redesigned GUI
  Sources page covering the same workflow.

## v0.4.2-alpha

### Added

- GUI duplicate review workflow, including a "select all visible" action for
  bulk-handling duplicate candidates.

## v0.4.1-alpha

### Added

- `library-remove-missing`: removes catalogue entries whose source file is
  gone, by exact id or path. It never deletes files - it only removes stale
  database rows.

## v0.4.0-alpha

### Added

- Platform detection provenance and scan summaries: the catalogue now
  records whether a platform came from the filename heuristic, the
  folder-alias fallback, or a manual override, and scans report a structured
  completion summary.

## v0.3.9-alpha

### Fixed

- GUI: an explicit float type on a focus-stroke width (a narrower, earlier
  instance of the same kind of ambiguous-literal issue fixed for Rust 1.97.1
  compatibility above).

## v0.3.8-alpha

### Added

- GUI: improved library table navigation and sorting.

## v0.3.7-alpha

### Fixed

- GUI: bulk archive selection made reliable.

## v0.3.6-alpha

### Changed

- Added an automated deployment smoke test (Nobara) to the project's CI
  tooling.

## v0.3.5-alpha

### Added

- `platform-alias-list`, `platform-alias-add`, and `platform-alias-remove`:
  persistent, user-defined folder-name-to-platform aliases.
- `--version` CLI output, aligned with the workspace version.

## v0.3.4-alpha

### Added

- An unknown-platform review workflow (`library-list --unknown-only`,
  `library-find --unknown-only`) for finding catalogue entries that need a
  manual platform assignment.

## v0.3.3-alpha

### Added

- `library-set-platform` and `library-clear-platform` (plus
  `-bulk` variants added in later releases): persistent manual platform
  assignments that outrank automatic detection.

## v0.3.2-alpha

### Fixed

- Scanner: nested archives inside N-Gage container files are skipped
  instead of being treated as separate top-level archives.

## v0.3.1-alpha

### Changed

- Improved platform detection using folder-name aliases as a fallback when
  the primary filename heuristic finds nothing.

## v0.3.0-alpha

### Added

- A persistent library database: a SQLite-backed catalogue
  (`archivefs-core::database`) that stores scanned archive records between
  runs, plus `library-status`, `library-scan`, `library-list`, and
  `library-find` CLI commands, and GUI integration that reads from the
  persistent catalogue instead of rescanning on every launch.
- Design documentation for the persistent library database.

Mount and unmount safety continued to read live filesystem and mount state
directly and were not made to depend on this new catalogue; see
[`docs/adr/0001-persistent-library-database.md`](docs/adr/0001-persistent-library-database.md).

## v0.2.3-alpha

### Fixed

- Config parser: `source_folders` arrays split across multiple lines are
  now accepted, not just single-line arrays.

## v0.2.2-alpha

### Added

- A safe Linux installer script (`install.sh`) that installs both binaries
  into `~/.local/bin`, sets up `~/.config/archivefs`, and never overwrites
  an existing config.

## v0.2.1-alpha

### Added

- Automated Linux release artifacts via GitHub Actions (the `release.yml`
  workflow, release tarballs, and `SHA256SUMS`).
- A release installation guide and an example configuration file
  (`config.toml.example`).
- MIT License.

### Documentation

- Updated GitHub issue templates.

## v0.2.0-alpha

### Added

- Desktop GUI: **Mount All**, a sequential bulk-mount workflow that reports per-archive outcomes and stops cleanly on failure
- Desktop GUI: **Unmount All**, the equivalent sequential bulk-unmount workflow, with optional cleanup of the archive's mount directory afterward
- Lazy-unmount recovery for mounts that are busy at unmount time, with a follow-up offer to remount once the previous mount has been released
- Activity panel in the GUI recording recent mount, unmount, and setup operations, with a Clear action
- First-run Setup flow and a startup Diagnostics report that check the config file, mount root, and required tools before archive actions are allowed
- `status --json` output, joining the existing `stats --json`, `info --json`, and `doctor --json`

### Changed

- README refreshed with a new project banner image and updated description

### Fixed / Safety

- The GUI now retains and can display the last known good snapshot when a background refresh fails, marking it stale instead of discarding it
- Mount and unmount actions are gated on a coherent config identity check (config path plus a SHA-256 digest of its contents), so actions are blocked if the on-disk config changed since the snapshot and diagnostics were last read

## v0.1.0-alpha

### Added

- Linux-first ArchiveScanner
- Read-only archive mounting
- JSON archive index
- File watcher
- Provider pipeline
- Duplicate detector framework
- Filename duplicate detector
- `doctor`
- `config-check`
- `stats`
- `info`
- `duplicates`
- `status`
- `watch`
- JSON output:
  - `stats --json`
  - `info --json`
  - `doctor --json`

### Quality

- GitHub Actions CI
- Clippy clean
- 59 unit tests
- Architecture documentation
- JSON API documentation
