# EmuWiz installer.
#
# Installs emuwiz-cli and emuwiz for the current user only: no
# sudo, no system-wide changes, no edits to shell startup files. Safe to
# run more than once - re-running reinstalls the binaries and never
# touches an existing config.
#
# Works from two locations (detected automatically):
#   - an extracted release bundle (bin/emuwiz-cli and bin/emuwiz)
#   - a workspace checkout after `cargo build --workspace --release`
#     (target/release/emuwiz-cli / target/release/emuwiz)
#
# Linux only: safe asset publication requires Python 3, procfs, O_PATH
# (Linux 2.6.39+), and descriptor-relative hardlink support on the install
# filesystem. Missing support fails closed; there is no overwrite fallback.
# Close native EmuWiz processes before upgrading: owned regular files update
# through held descriptors, non-atomically, just like the ownership manifest.
# Hardlinked files refuse changed-byte updates. A running EmuWiz is detected before
# anything is published (see preflight_binary_slot) and asks the user to close it.
#
# OWNERSHIP TRACKING
#
# Every path this script writes (binaries, legacy aliases, the desktop
# entry, hicolor icons) is recorded in a small manifest under
# $XDG_DATA_HOME/emuwiz-installer/manifest after a successful install. On
# every later run - reinstall or uninstall - that manifest is what proves a
# given path is still the exact thing this installer put there, rather than
# trusting the filename, its timestamp, or its inode alone. A path occupied
# by something else (a foreign file, a foreign symlink, a directory) is
# never silently overwritten or removed; it is left alone with a clear
# warning. See the "OWNERSHIP MODEL" comment block below for the full
# design.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OWNERSHIP MODEL
#
# The manifest lives at $data_home/emuwiz-installer/manifest (never inside
# $data_home/emuwiz, which is the *application's* data directory, kept
# strictly separate so uninstall never has to reach into user data to clean
# up its own bookkeeping). It is a flat, line-oriented, non-executable text
# file - never sourced or eval'd as shell - with a fixed header (schema_version,
# bin_dir, data_home, record_count) followed by exactly record_count lines,
# one per tracked path, keyed by a fixed, closed set of slot names, and
# terminated by a literal "end" line:
#
#   bin-emuwiz-cli, bin-emuwiz                              (regular files)
#   alias-archivefs-cli, alias-emuwiz-gui, alias-archivefs-gui  (symlinks)
#   desktop                                                 (regular file)
#   icon-32, icon-64, icon-128, icon-256, icon-512          (regular files)
#
# A file slot line is "<slot> file <sha256-hex> <size-bytes>": the SHA-256
# digest of the installed file's exact byte content is the sole ownership
# proof - size is recorded only as supplemental metadata for diagnostics
# and is never consulted by any ownership decision. A symlink slot line is
# "<slot> symlink <target>": the target is the symlink's literal, raw
# readlink() value, which this installer only ever sets to one of two fixed
# values.
#
# CONTENT, not mtime, not inode. mtime was the original design and was
# rejected after a hostile review reproduced two real failures: `touch -r`
# from a genuinely owned file, or `cp -p`/`touch -d` to the installer's own
# recorded timestamp, let a byte-for-byte DIFFERENT foreign file pass the
# ownership check purely by forging the one signal being trusted. Inode
# number was tried before that and rejected too - empirical testing on
# plain ext4 showed a freed inode gets reused by the very next allocation
# with no attacker involved at all, so "the inode still matches" was
# already a false positive waiting to happen even without a forged
# timestamp. A cryptographic digest of the actual bytes has no equivalent
# forgery surface within this installer's threat model (no sudo, current
# user only, no chosen-prefix-collision attack against SHA-256 itself) -
# forging it requires reproducing the exact content, which is precisely
# what "provably the same file" means.
#
# Critically: install.sh NEVER reads a path out of the manifest. Every path
# it might create, verify or remove is always the one it independently
# computes right now from $bin_dir/$data_home/$desktop_id - the same way it
# always has. The manifest is consulted only as a slot-name-keyed lookup
# table of "kind + digest [+ size]", strictly validated against the shapes
# above on every read; anything that doesn't parse as one of those exact
# shapes invalidates the WHOLE manifest (see the parser rules below), never
# just the one bad line. A corrupted, truncated or hand-edited manifest can
# therefore never cause install.sh to touch a path other than the fixed set
# it was already going to consider - at worst it makes an owned path look
# unowned, which only ever means "ask again" (fail safe), never "delete
# something else instead".
#
# PARSER: fail-closed, not best-effort. A manifest is accepted only if, in
# one pass:
#   - exactly one schema_version line, whose value is the current schema
#   - exactly one bin_dir line, matching this invocation's resolved bin_dir
#   - exactly one data_home line, matching this invocation's data_home
#   - exactly one record_count line, a plain non-negative integer
#   - zero or more slot record lines, each for one of the fixed slot names
#     above, each appearing at most once (a second line for a slot already
#     seen invalidates the whole manifest - never "last one wins")
#   - a slot record's fields are validated strictly: a file slot's digest
#     must be exactly 64 lowercase hex characters and its size a plain
#     digit string; a symlink slot's target must be exactly one of the
#     finite set of targets this installer ever writes. Anything else
#     invalidates the whole manifest.
#   - no line of any other shape (an unrecognised key, a duplicate header,
#     anything appearing after the end marker) - the whole manifest is
#     invalidated, not just that line
#   - a single literal "end" line, exactly once, as the last line - nothing
#     may follow it, and a manifest is never accepted without one
#   - the number of slot record lines actually present exactly equals the
#     declared record_count
# Both record_count AND the "end" marker are required (belt and braces):
# either one alone already rules out "valid header followed by truncation"
# passing as complete, since a truncated file can supply at most one of
# "the declared count matches" or "the file has a terminator" but never a
# consistent forgery of both without simply being the real, untruncated
# file. A manifest that fails ANY of these checks is treated exactly like
# no manifest existing at all - every slot then falls back to the
# per-asset-type recognition rules below.
#
# Intentionally partial manifests ARE part of the design: a run that left
# some destinations foreign (no --replace-foreign) still writes a manifest
# recording only the slots it actually installed - record_count reflects
# that smaller number, not 11. A slot with no record in an otherwise valid,
# accepted manifest simply falls back to the same per-asset-type
# recognition rule as "no manifest at all", scoped to just that slot.
#
# No manifest, or a record for a bin_dir/data_home this run doesn't match,
# or no record for a given slot: that slot falls back to a per-asset-type
# recognition rule instead of blind trust - and the rule is only ever
# "recognise it" where that is actually provable, never "assume it because
# the name matches":
#   - binaries (bin-emuwiz-cli, bin-emuwiz): no recognition rule at all.
#     Binary *content* legitimately differs release to release, so there is
#     no byte pattern - or anything else - that safely proves an existing
#     file is this installer's own without a manifest entry to check
#     against. An unrecorded binary path is always foreign. The practical
#     effect: the first run of this installer version against an install
#     that predates it treats its own existing binaries as foreign and asks
#     for --replace-foreign once; every run after that has a manifest and
#     needs nothing special. A one-time migration step, not a permanent
#     regression - and the only honest answer once "adopt any executable
#     file at this name" is off the table as unprovable.
#   - aliases (alias-*): an existing symlink whose target is exactly the
#     one value this installer would itself write ("emuwiz-cli" or
#     "emuwiz") is adopted. This is close to proof, not a guess - a
#     coincidentally-matching relative symlink target at this exact path is
#     implausible, and unlike a binary's bytes, this target string is fixed
#     content this installer has always written verbatim.
#   - desktop entry: adopted only if it is byte-identical to what this run
#     would render, ignoring the "Exec=" line specifically (which
#     legitimately varies with --prefix across installs). Real proof, not a
#     heuristic.
#   - icons: adopted only if byte-identical to the exact approved source
#     asset for that size. Real proof.
# Anything that fails its recognition rule - including every case a
# directory or a foreign symlink occupies the path - is foreign: never
# overwritten or removed without the caller opting in (--replace-foreign
# for install; uninstall never overwrites/removes a foreign path at all).
#
# UPGRADE ORDERING: a legitimate reinstall over a newer release's binaries
# gates on the digest currently sitting at the destination - the OLD
# installed content - against the OLD recorded manifest digest, strictly
# BEFORE that destination is overwritten with the new bundled asset. Only
# once that gate passes does the copy happen, and only after the copy
# succeeds is the NEW digest computed and recorded. The new bundled asset's
# own digest never enters the ownership decision for what it is about to
# replace - comparing "what's already installed" against "what we're about
# to install" would make every version bump look foreign (the bytes always
# differ) and would also make an unrelated foreign file that happens to
# match some OTHER version's digest look owned. Both directions are wrong;
# only "does the CURRENT installed content match the LAST thing we
# ourselves recorded" is the right question.
#
# Publication remains nontransactional; no asset rollback is attempted. Each
# managed publication rechecks the bookkeeping binding. New metadata is linked
# into an absent name without clobbering; existing metadata is written through
# its validated descriptor (not a rename over a possibly replaced pathname).
# Descriptor writes are not atomic: interrupted writes may leave a truncated
# owned manifest, which fails closed on the next run. An external late change
# stops further publication; assets already published may remain unrecorded.
# The directory lock serializes cooperating installers and uninstallers. It
# does not prohibit another same-user process from editing these writable paths.
# Assets use the same pinning model: absent names are linked without clobbering
# from held staged inodes; verified regular files update through held inodes;
# fixed aliases are validated and retained. Each operation is relative to a
# pinned parent directory and checks its binding before and after publication.
# Asset records describe the held published bytes/target, never a fresh read
# that could adopt a substituted foreign object after publication.
#
# MANIFEST-DIRECTORY SAFETY: $data_home itself - wherever XDG_DATA_HOME
# resolves to, symlinked or not - is trusted exactly as much as it already
# was for every other asset this installer writes there (the desktop entry,
# the icons); a symlinked XDG_DATA_HOME pointing at a different disk is a
# completely ordinary, legitimate setup and nothing about ownership
# tracking treats it with any more suspicion than the rest of this script
# always has. The boundary that IS enforced is narrower and specific to
# this feature: the final "emuwiz-installer" path component, which this
# installer alone creates and fully owns, must be a real directory - never
# a symlink, and never anything else occupying that exact name. If it does
# not exist yet, install creates it fresh as a real directory, mode 0700.
# If something already occupies that name and is not a real directory,
# install refuses to proceed at all (there is nowhere left it could
# trustworthily record ownership of anything this run installs);
# uninstall, which never creates anything, simply treats it exactly like
# "no manifest" and never touches that path. Symmetrically, the manifest
# FILE itself is only ever written through its validated descriptor, or
# created without clobbering if absent. Its identity/content and the bookkeeping
# directory binding are checked before each managed publication. A pre-existing
# path there that did NOT load - a
# symlink, a directory, or simply a regular file whose content is not one
# of our own manifests - is treated exactly like any other foreign
# collision in this script: left untouched with a warning by default
# (the install is refused before any managed asset is published), or moved
# aside into a fresh backup - never silently
# written through or over - with --replace-foreign.

Usage: $program_name [--prefix PATH] [--replace-foreign] [--uninstall] [--help]

Install EmuWiz (emuwiz-cli, emuwiz) for the current user.
No sudo is used and no shell startup files are modified.

Options:
  --prefix PATH      Install the binaries into PATH instead of the default
                      ($default_bin_dir). The directory is created if needed.
                      PATH should normally be an absolute path.
  --replace-foreign   Install only: when a binary, alias, desktop entry,
                      icon, or the ownership manifest itself is occupied by
                      something this installer did not put there, move it
                      aside into a freshly and securely created backup
                      directory next to it and install in its place. The
                      exact backup location is printed. Without this flag
                      such a path is left untouched and a warning is
                      printed; a foreign ownership manifest refuses the
                      install before any managed file is published.
  --uninstall         Remove EmuWiz binaries, its desktop entry and application
                      icons - but only the ones still provably EmuWiz-owned.
                      A path that was replaced by something else since it was
                      installed is left alone, with a warning. Your config at
                      $config_file is never touched.
  --help              Show this help and exit.

Without --uninstall, this script:
  1. Detects whether it is running from an extracted release bundle or a
     workspace checkout with release binaries already built, and fails
     with a clear message if neither is found.
  2. Copies emuwiz-cli and emuwiz into the install directory
     and makes sure they are executable - unless that destination is
     occupied by something foreign (see --replace-foreign above).
  3. Installs one EmuWiz desktop launcher and its approved application icons
     below $data_home, subject to the same foreign-path protection.
  4. Records what it just installed in a SHA-256-backed ownership manifest
     under $manifest_dir, so a later reinstall or uninstall can tell
     EmuWiz-owned paths apart from unrelated ones with the same name -
     never by filename, timestamp or inode alone.
  5. Creates $config_dir if it does not exist.
  6. Copies config.toml.example to $config_file, but only if that file
     does not already exist. An existing config is never overwritten.
  7. If a new config was just written and this script is running
     interactively, optionally prompts for one archive source folder to
     add via 'emuwiz-cli source add'. Leave blank to skip - source
     folders are never required at install time, and more can always be
     added later from the Sources page in the GUI or the CLI. Never
     offered for an existing config, and never offered for a
     non-interactive install.
  8. Checks whether ratarmount is on PATH and prints installation
     guidance if it is not (EmuWiz uses it to mount archives).

# been pre-planted by anything - there is no predictable name here for
# anything to race or pre-occupy, unlike a PID- or timestamp-derived name.
# The foreign object is then moved, under its own original basename, into
# that directory: since the directory was just created empty and exclusively
# by us, that destination is guaranteed not to exist yet either, so the
# move can never clobber anything (mv -n is added as a second, redundant
# guard rather than the only one). mv operates on PATH itself when PATH is
# a symlink - it is never dereferenced or followed. Sets BACKUP_PATH to the
# exact resulting location, which is the deterministic recovery
# instruction: the foreign object is never deleted, only moved, and stays
# exactly there - including if a later step in this same install run then
# fails, since nothing after this function ever touches BACKUP_PATH again.

# string-type value (Exec included) is first run through the format's
# generic backslash-unescape pass (which recognises only \\, \s, \n, \t,
# \r) before the Exec-specific quoting rules below are ever applied to it.
# That generic pass collapses "\\" down to one "\" before an Exec parser
# sees it, so to have *one* backslash survive as the Exec-quoted escape
# sequence "\\" (which itself decodes to one literal backslash), the file
# must contain "\\\\". Two backslashes here would collapse to a single
# stray "\" that desktop-file-validate then folds into whatever character
# follows it, breaking quote tracking for the rest of the value - which is
# exactly what upstream desktop-file-utils' own parser documents in
