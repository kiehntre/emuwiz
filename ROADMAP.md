# EmuWiz Roadmap

This roadmap is reconstructed from the current codebase, its test suite, and
its commit/tag history - not from a fixed release schedule. It contains no
promised dates. Items move from later sections to "Completed foundations" only
once they are actually implemented and tested.

For what has already shipped release-by-release, see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## Completed foundations

These are implemented, tested, and in current use today:

- Read-only archive mounting through `ratarmount`, with safe mount-name
  generation and deterministic handling of duplicate names.
- Source and destination path validation: mounts are only created under the
  configured `mount_root`; unmounts only ever target paths under it; source
  folders are validated against overlap with each other and with mount roots
  and Library View destinations.
- Safe path handling for non-UTF-8 archive paths, symlink-escape checks
  around `mount_root`, and parent-only resolution during lazy-unmount
  validation.
- Batch mounting and unmounting (Mount All / Unmount All in the GUI, `mount`
  / `unmount` in the CLI), with per-archive outcome reporting and lazy-unmount
  recovery for busy mounts.
- Execution-time revalidation: mount/unmount actions are gated on a config
  identity check (path plus content digest), so a config change since the
  last scan blocks stale actions instead of silently acting on old state.
- GUI progress reporting, operation summaries, and an activity history panel
  for recent mount/unmount/setup operations.
- Cleanup handling (`clean`) that removes empty mount directories without
  touching mounted or non-empty ones.
- A persistent SQLite-backed library catalogue (`archivefs-core::database`),
  additive to and never a dependency of mount/unmount safety - see
  [`docs/adr/0001-persistent-library-database.md`](docs/adr/0001-persistent-library-database.md).
- Read-only database diagnosis (`database-check`, including stable JSON), with
  sidecar evidence, bounded consistency checking, and recovery guidance that
  never performs automatic repair.
- Multi-source folder management (`sources`, `source add/enable/disable/scan/remove`)
  with independent per-source scan status.
- Manual platform assignment and persistent folder-name platform aliases
  that outrank automatic detection, plus an unknown-platform review
  workflow.
- Filename-based duplicate detection (`duplicates`, `FilenameDuplicateDetector`)
  and a GUI duplicate review workflow.
- Managed library views: named, symlink-based organized views of the
  catalogue with plan/preview/apply/repair/remove semantics and a manifest
  that records exactly which symlinks EmuWiz created, so repair and
  removal only ever touch paths EmuWiz manages.
- A read-only archive content inspector used to improve mount-readiness
  checks without extracting archives.
- A read-only PCSX2 patch-preview foundation: fetches official PCSX2 patch
  metadata and reports native/Flatpak installation candidates as a
  non-executable advisory plan. It does not download, install, or enable
  anything.
- An emulator-neutral patch adapter boundary (`EmulatorAdapter` and related
  types), extracted from the PCSX2-specific implementation so future
  adapters do not require redesigning the shared orchestration. PCSX2 is
  currently the only adapter built on this boundary.
- Stable JSON output for `status`, `stats`, and `info`, documented and
  guarded by tests in [`docs/json-api.md`](docs/json-api.md).
- Deterministic plan generation (mount plans and Library View plans produce
  the same result for the same inputs) and regression tests pinned to real
  historical plan-ID values.
- A reproducible Rust toolchain: `rust-toolchain.toml` pins an exact Rust
  version, and CI and release workflows install that exact version instead
  of a floating `stable` channel.
- Read-only RetroArch environment discovery (`retroarch-environment`):
  detects a native and a Flatpak (user- and system-scope) RetroArch
  profile, locates and parses `retroarch.cfg` for a fixed set of
  configured paths, and inventories installed cores and their `.info`
  metadata. This is a sibling to the patch-preview adapter boundary above,
  not an implementation of `EmulatorAdapter`; see
  [`docs/RETROARCH_ENVIRONMENT.md`](docs/RETROARCH_ENVIRONMENT.md).
- A read-only RetroArch cheat/patch destination preview
  (`retroarch-patch-preview`): the second concrete preview built on
  `patch_manager`, after PCSX2. For every present catalogue archive, it
  previews per-game `.cht` cheat destinations (when exactly one installed
  core supports the archive's own file extension) and IPS/BPS/UPS/Xdelta
  soft-patch sibling destinations, across every discovered RetroArch
  profile - reusing the environment discovery above rather than
  rediscovering any path, and making no network call at all. It
  deliberately does *not* implement `EmulatorAdapter` or produce an
  `AdvisoryPatchPlan` - RetroArch's multi-root, core-selection-ambiguous
  shape does not fit PCSX2's trait/type, so it is a separate, narrowly-
  scoped `RetroArchAdvisoryPlan` instead; see
  [`docs/RETROARCH_PATCH_PREVIEW.md`](docs/RETROARCH_PATCH_PREVIEW.md).
- Read-only RetroArch playlist identity and content matching: discovers
  and parses modern JSON `.lpl` playlist files from the already-discovered
  Playlists directory and uses them as additional catalogue-matching and
  core-association evidence in `retroarch-patch-preview` - strengthening
  or resolving what extension-only matching alone leaves ambiguous,
  without ever downgrading an already-correct result. No playlist is ever
  written or modified. Purely additive to both `retroarch-environment
  --json` and `retroarch-patch-preview --json`; see
  [`docs/RETROARCH_PLAYLISTS.md`](docs/RETROARCH_PLAYLISTS.md).
- Read-only RetroArch AppImage detection: scans a fixed set of default
  locations and XDG desktop-entry directories for RetroArch AppImages -
  many users' primary way of running RetroArch on Linux - and feeds any
  found AppImage into the existing environment/playlist/patch-preview
  pipeline without ever executing, mounting, or extracting it, and
  without creating a duplicate profile when it shares the existing
  RetroArch configuration. `retroarch-environment --json`'s
  `format_version` moved from `1` to `2` for this, since a
  distinct-configuration AppImage inserts a 4th profile into a previously
  fixed-length, positionally-relied-upon array; see
  [`docs/RETROARCH_APPIMAGE.md`](docs/RETROARCH_APPIMAGE.md).
- Read-only RetroArch cheat/patch artifact inventory: the existing
  `retroarch-patch-preview` now enumerates bounded `.cht` files beneath
  configured cheat roots and `.ips`/`.bps`/`.ups`/`.xdelta` files in
  catalogue-relevant content directories, then reports exact, strong,
  weak, ambiguous, duplicate, conflicting, and orphaned associations. It
  parses only bounded `.cht` metadata and never mutates or follows an
  artifact symlink; see
  [`docs/RETROARCH_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md`](docs/RETROARCH_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md).
- Read-only external cheat catalogue discovery and matching
  (`retroarch-cheat-catalogue <local-path>`): matches a local `.cht`
  directory tree or bounded JSON manifest against catalogued games using
  conservative serial/content-hash/playlist-identity/title-platform-region
  evidence tiers, cross-references `retroarch-patch-preview`'s existing
  artifact inventory for installed-state, and never downloads, installs,
  enables, or applies a cheat. No network access; local sources only. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CATALOGUE.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CATALOGUE.md).

- Safe, journal-driven rollback for RetroArch cheat installations is now
  available via `retroarch-cheat-rollback`, and also from the GUI's History
  & Logs page through the shared rollback transaction (see the GUI
  apply/history/rollback item further down this list).
- Read-only RetroArch cheat installation history and journal inspection are
  available via `retroarch-cheat-history` and `retroarch-cheat-inspect`, with
  destination/backup hash assessment, strongly bound rollback-journal
  discovery, stable JSON, and fail-closed path/symlink handling; see
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_HISTORY.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_HISTORY.md).
- Guided RetroArch cheat setup is available via
  `retroarch-cheat-setup <catalogue-path>`. It reuses environment discovery,
  exact profile IDs, read-only matching, destination safety, and the existing
  installer/history/journal/rollback systems; it adds no downloader or GUI.
  See [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SETUP.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SETUP.md).
- Trusted RetroArch catalogue retrieval is available through a reviewed
  registry, bounded HTTPS, redirect/SSRF policy, safe ZIP extraction, strict
  existing-parser validation, immutable content-addressed snapshots,
  provenance inspection, offline reuse, and guided `--source` setup. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md).
- Immutable RetroArch cheat snapshots have deterministic inventory, explicit
  integrity verification, external atomic pins, conservative prune planning,
  confirmed per-candidate deletion revalidation, and deliberate abandoned
  staging cleanup. There is no automatic pruning. See
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CACHE_MAINTENANCE.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_CACHE_MAINTENANCE.md).
- A read-only PCSX2 profile and PNACH inspection adapter in the Cheats &
  Mods GUI workspace: discovers native/Flatpak/portable PCSX2 profiles and
  inspects existing `cheats`/`cheats_ws`/`patches` directories, gated to
  PS2 archives only. Exact CRC matching remains deferred pending a
  verified PS2 executable CRC. See "PCSX2 read-only adapter" in
  [`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md`](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md).
- A read-only Dolphin profile and Game INI inspection adapter in the same
  workspace (GameCube/Wii archives only; no texture-pack or graphics-mod
  inspection; exact matching deferred pending a verified Dolphin Game ID).
  It ships as its own module (`patch_manager::dolphin_local`), not a
  change to the `EmulatorAdapter` trait or the shared orchestration layer
  below. See "Dolphin read-only adapter" in
  [`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md`](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.5.0-alpha.md).
- Shared verified game identity: bounded, read-only PS2/GameCube/Wii disc
  identity extraction feeding exact matching in the PCSX2 and Dolphin
  adapters; see
  [`docs/SHARED_GAME_IDENTITY.md`](docs/SHARED_GAME_IDENTITY.md).
- A shared read-only Cheats & Mods preview/conflict model across all three
  adapters, and a shared safe apply/backup/journal/rollback transaction
  foundation with atomic writes, locking, and truthful partial-success
  reporting; see
  [`docs/SHARED_CHEAT_PREVIEW.md`](docs/SHARED_CHEAT_PREVIEW.md) and
  [`docs/SHARED_SAFE_APPLY_ROLLBACK.md`](docs/SHARED_SAFE_APPLY_ROLLBACK.md).
- A working RetroArch GUI apply/history/rollback flow connecting an
  eligible trusted-catalogue match to the shared transaction engine; see
  [`docs/RETROARCH_GUI_APPLY_HISTORY.md`](docs/RETROARCH_GUI_APPLY_HISTORY.md).
- RetroArch trusted-catalogue download and management from the Sources
  page (Download/Update/Verify, explicit review-then-confirm, background
  retrieval with cancellation); see
  [`docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md`](docs/RETROARCH_CHEAT_SOURCES.md).
- Recently Found and Mega Drive/Genesis loose-ROM recognition; see
  [`docs/LIBRARY_SCAN_USABILITY.md`](docs/LIBRARY_SCAN_USABILITY.md).
- RetroArch catalogue parse-tolerance: an individual malformed or
  unsupported catalogue entry no longer affects validation of the whole
  snapshot (`CatalogueIndexState::UsablePartial`, bounded per-entry
  exclusion reporting); the Libretro catalogue archive per-entry (256 MiB)
  and expanded (1 GiB) size limits were raised to match the real official
  catalogue; the stale "Archive matching and cheat installation are not yet
  implemented" Cheats & Mods copy was removed.
- An optional RomM server as a read-only external identity source:
  configuration, bounded catalogue import, browsing, per-archive identity
  matching, and cover artwork, from both the CLI (`identity source romm
  ...`) and the GUI (Sources → RomM). Only loopback/private-LAN addresses
  are accepted, and no command writes to RomM, triggers a scan on it, or
  touches a ROM.

## Current development

The current workspace is post-`v0.8.3` `main`; `v0.8.3` is the latest published
release. Direct-image discovery, canonical platform aliases, source platform
assignment, platform-first navigation, Dolphin and supported BSFree
installation, Xenia Canary patch support, Games-only DAT selection, and EmuWiz
Linux desktop integration are present on `main`. Post-release work is not
retroactively part of `v0.8.3`.

The shared `patch_manager` orchestration layer (platform filtering,
ambiguity heuristics, plan assembly in `patch_manager::mod`) remains
specific to the original PCSX2 patch-preview foundation and
adapter-parameterized only through `EmulatorAdapter`'s narrow read-only
surface; see [`docs/PATCH_CHEAT_MANAGER_DESIGN.md`](docs/PATCH_CHEAT_MANAGER_DESIGN.md).
RetroArch's preview and the Dolphin adapter both deliberately did not
generalize or extend this layer - each shipped as its own independent
module instead, since neither shape fit `EmulatorAdapter`'s
PCSX2-patch-preview-specific design. The newer PCSX2 Cheats & Mods workflow is
likewise independent of that original preview trait and feeds approved records
into the shared preview/apply/rollback transaction path.

Ongoing library inspection and catalogue-health improvements build on the
archive inspector and `CatalogueHealthReport`. Documentation maintenance
keeps this roadmap, the architecture docs, and the changelog aligned with
the code as these areas change.

## Next milestones

Realistic, concrete next steps, in the recommended order below:

1. **Unified recovery and operation receipts** - make recovery, refresh,
   reconcile, and mutation outcomes explainable through one receipt model;
   completion remains subject to implementation and tests.
2. **DAT completeness and authority** - strengthen completeness reporting and
   make authority/provenance boundaries clearer across the current DAT flows.
3. **Needs Attention and refresh/reconcile** - provide one actionable queue for
   unresolved identity, stale state, incomplete DAT evidence, and recoverable
   operations; completion is not yet claimed.
4. **First-run comprehension** - guide new users through Understand → Fix →
   Organise → Play without changing the safety boundaries.
5. **100k profiling** - measure realistic 100,000-item collections and address
   bottlenecks found by traces rather than assuming scale characteristics.

Release process discipline (a documented, repeatable release checklist
tied to the pinned toolchain) already exists at
[`docs/release-checklist.md`](docs/release-checklist.md).

## Medium-term plans

Directions consistent with the architecture already in place, not yet
scheduled:

- **1.0 reliability/comprehension milestone.** A later 1.0 milestone remains
  focused on dependable recovery, clear state/comprehension, and measured
  large-library operation. It is not a promise that the 0.9 work is complete.

- **Emulator adapter expansion pauses after Xenia.** The immediate priority
  is hardening the existing RetroArch, PCSX2, Dolphin, and Xenia workflows,
  not adding another emulator. Further adapters - PPSSPP, RPCS3, Switch,
  MAME, and Amiga/WHDLoad - are not scheduled.
  Switch is additionally sensitive (keys, firmware) and would need its own
  separate policy decision before any design work, not just an
  architecture review. Each would still follow the same
  read-only-inspection-first pattern if and when real user demand and an
  architecture review justify revisiting this pause.
- Library health reporting beyond today's `CatalogueHealthReport`: damaged
  or unreadable archives, likely duplicates, missing BIOS/firmware
  detection, and region/revision information, where that information can be
  derived from local data.
- Deeper preservation-metadata integration built on the identity fields
  `ArchiveIdentity` already reserves (`content_hash`, `archive_hash`,
  `internal_listing_hash`).
- Launch-preparation workflows once an adapter can safely describe what a
  launch would require, without EmuWiz becoming a launcher itself.
- Additional JSON output for more commands, and automation/scripting/CLI
  integration built on the existing JSON stability guarantees in
  [`docs/json-api.md`](docs/json-api.md).

## Longer-term research

These are research directions only. None of them are promised, scheduled,
or currently implemented in any form:

- Further optional catalogue/verification and metadata providers beyond the
  current DAT and RomM source pipelines, where provenance and offline-safe
  caching can meet the provider principles in
  [`docs/provider-pipeline.md`](docs/provider-pipeline.md).
- Further patch, cheat, and artwork providers beyond the currently reviewed
  RetroArch, Dolphin, Xenia, GameHacking, BSFree, RomM, and local-artwork
  sources.
- Update/DLC awareness for preservation collections.
- Preservation-format guidance (for example CHD, RVZ, WUA, CSO, alongside
  the ZIP/7z/RAR archives already supported) - guidance and detection only,
  not conversion tooling, unless a future design explicitly proposes that.
- Interop with existing frontends such as ES-DE, RetroDECK, or LaunchBox,
  where that is practical without EmuWiz taking over their role.
- Remote-play workflow documentation (for example Sunshine/Moonlight) for
  users who already use EmuWiz-managed libraries with those tools.

## Explicitly out of scope for now

EmuWiz is not, and these are not planned:

- A ROM, BIOS, firmware, or game download service.
- A storefront or marketplace for any kind of software or media.
- A DRM system, license-enforcement layer, or content-restriction system.
- A mandatory cloud account or cloud-dependent service - EmuWiz is
  local-first and must keep working offline.
- A telemetry or usage-analytics platform.
- A surveillance system, or any component that reports on user files to a
  third party.
- An arbiter of which files a user is "allowed" to keep or use.
- A universal emulator, launcher, or frontend replacement. Emulator
  adapters describe and preview; they do not launch games or take over
  frontend responsibilities.
